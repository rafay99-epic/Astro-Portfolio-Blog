#### 1. Get Google AI Studio API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the API key

#### 2. Configure Environment Variables
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp scripts/env.example scripts/.env

# Edit the file and add your API key
nano scripts/.env
```

Or set environment variables directly:
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export AI_ENABLED=true
```

### Usage

```bash
# Run the script from the project root
./scripts/generate-changelog.sh

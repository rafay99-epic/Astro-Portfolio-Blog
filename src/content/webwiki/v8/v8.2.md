  - Improved prop management
  - Optimized GitHub Stats component architecture
- **Styling Organization**:
  - Consistent use of Tailwind classes
  - Better organization of custom styles
  - Improved theme variable usage
  - Enhanced view-specific styling

## Technical Details

### Animation System

```typescript
// Animation variants for smooth transitions
const containerVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 30 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    transition: {
      duration: 0.8,
      ease: "easeOut",
      staggerChildren: 0.2,
    },
  },
};
```

### GitHub Stats View System

```typescript
// View switching logic with React 19 memo
const GitHubStatsUI = memo(function GitHubStatsUI({
  stats,
  error,
}: GitHubStatsUIProps) {
  const [currentView, setCurrentView] = useState<ViewMode>('dashboard');

  const renderView = () => {
    switch (currentView) {
      case 'minimal':
        return <MinimalView stats={displayStats} />;
      case 'classic':
        return <ClassicView stats={displayStats} />;
      case 'terminal':
        return <TerminalView stats={displayStats} />;
      default:
        return <DashboardView stats={displayStats} />;
    }
  };
  // ... rest of the component
});
```

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-specific optimizations
- Fluid typography scaling
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes

## Future Considerations

- Further performance optimizations for image loading
- Enhanced accessibility features
- Additional animation refinements
- Potential dark/light theme toggle integration
- Consider adding more GitHub statistics views
- Explore real-time data updates for GitHub stats

## Migration Notes

No breaking changes introduced. All improvements are backwards compatible with existing implementations. The GitHub Stats component's default view has been changed to Dashboard, but all other views remain accessible through the view switcher.

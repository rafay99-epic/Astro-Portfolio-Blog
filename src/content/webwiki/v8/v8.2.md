## Minor Improvements

### ComingSoon Component Overhaul

- **Enhanced Visual Design**: Completely redesigned with modern aesthetics
  - Added animated gradient background with pulsing blobs
  - Implemented glass-morphism cards with dynamic blur effects
  - Created smooth hover and interaction animations
- **Improved Layout**:
  - Increased container width (`max-w-5xl`) for better content display
  - Optimized spacing and padding for different screen sizes
  - Added responsive typography scaling
- **Feature Preview Cards**:
  - Implemented a 3-column grid layout for feature previews
  - Added hover animations and glass-morphism effects
  - Improved spacing with `gap-6` and centered alignment
- **Progress Indicator**:
  - Enhanced progress bar with gradient fill and pulse animation
  - Added percentage completion display
  - Improved visibility with larger height and better spacing
- **Simplified Navigation**:
  - Streamlined to single "Back to Home" button for clearer user flow
  - Added animated arrow indicator
  - Enhanced button with gradient background and hover effects

### Header Component Refinements

- **Feature Flag Integration**:
  - Implemented conditional rendering based on feature flags
  - Separated Wiki navigation into its own feature flag
  - Streamlined navigation items for better organization
- **Mobile Menu Improvements**:
  - Enhanced dropdown animations
  - Improved touch targets for better mobile accessibility
  - Added consistent spacing and visual hierarchy
- **Visual Consistency**:
  - Maintained Tokyo Night theme color scheme
  - Consistent use of gradients and hover effects
  - Unified animation timings across components

### Performance Optimizations

- **Component Loading**:
  - Optimized hydration strategies
  - Improved component lazy loading
  - Reduced initial bundle size
- **Animation Performance**:
  - Implemented hardware-accelerated animations
  - Optimized animation frame rates
  - Reduced layout thrashing

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Component Structure**:
  - Better separation of concerns
  - Enhanced TypeScript type definitions
  - Improved prop management
- **Styling Organization**:
  - Consistent use of Tailwind classes
  - Better organization of custom styles
  - Improved theme variable usage

## Technical Details

### Animation System

```typescript
// Animation variants for smooth transitions
const containerVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 30 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    transition: {
      duration: 0.8,
      ease: "easeOut",
      staggerChildren: 0.2,
    },
  },
};
```

### Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-specific optimizations
- Fluid typography scaling
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes

## Future Considerations

- Further performance optimizations for image loading
- Enhanced accessibility features
- Additional animation refinements
- Potential dark/light theme toggle integration

## Migration Notes

No breaking changes introduced. All improvements are backwards compatible with existing implementations.

I'm excited to share some powerful new features and improvements that just landed in my [Astro Portfolio Blog](https://github.com/rafay99-epic/Astro-Portfolio-Blog/pull/101). This update focuses on expanding interactivity, improving performance, and elevating the user experience.

## ✨ What’s New?

### 🔒 Secure Image Upload Interface with Preview

A new dedicated **upload page** is now live, featuring:

- A React-powered image uploader using **UploadThing**
- Instant preview after selection
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for uploaded image URLs
- Simple, secure access via a secret key in the URL

This makes it easy for me to upload and share assets directly through the site without backend overhead.

### 🧠 Smart Parking Assistant – New Project Added

The **Smart Parking Assistant** project is now part of the portfolio!
It showcases:

- Real-time parking detection using machine learning
- Hardware-software integration
- Optimized algorithms for space availability tracking

Check it out under the Projects section for a full breakdown of tech and implementation.

I’ve transitioned the About section into a **React component** to improve layout, interactivity, and performance:

- Added smooth **animated transitions**
- Updated my bio to better reflect my current work and skills
- Improved responsiveness for all screen sizes

## 🛠 Enhancements & Refactors

- Project images now load from external URLs to ensure faster rendering and improved reliability.
- Introduced **Vercel Speed Insights** to track performance bottlenecks.

**Pull Request:** [#94 - Blog Auto-Publish & Improvements](https://github.com/rafay99-epic/Astro-Portfolio-Blog/pull/94)

I'm excited to share the updates brought in with PR #94, which introduces some powerful automation features and a few important improvements to the project!

## âœ¨ New Features

- **Automated Blog Publishing:**  
  Blog posts can now be scheduled for future publication. Once the scheduled time arrives, the system will automatically publish them without any manual intervention.
- **GitHub Actions Workflow:**  
  A new workflow runs **hourly** or **on-demand** to check for posts that need to be published. This ensures that your content goes live precisely when intended!

- **CodeRabbit AI and Bruno Collections Setup:**  
  Added configuration files to better integrate with CodeRabbit AI and manage API collections through Bruno, improving collaboration and automation support.

## ðŸ›  Chores

- **Version Update:**  
  The project version has been bumped to **6.1.0** to reflect the new feature set and improvements.
- **.gitignore Update:**  
  Jupyter notebook checkpoint files (`.ipynb_checkpoints/`) are now excluded from Git tracking to keep the repository clean.

## ðŸ“š Documentation

- **New Jupyter Notebook:**  
  Added a demonstration script in the form of a Jupyter notebook that walks through the blog auto-publishing logic, making it easier for contributors to understand and extend the system.

These updates make the blog system much smarter, more maintainable, and more contributor-friendly.

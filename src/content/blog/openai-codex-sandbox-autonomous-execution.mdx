Not too long ago, AI Coding was every where, i have heard so much good about the Claude models and Open AI Codex model, but these things and subscriptions are expensives plus comes with limit as well. I just recentely bough the claude code subscription and I was loving, i Could debugging logical stuff, create stunning looking AI by giving very specific colors scheme, formate and reference matter, and I did not add any skills or any thing to the claude code, Just Claude.md file and then done. I will tell my problem and it fixes it very well.&#x20;

​

But then Like tommoror Open AI Just released Codex App, for there coding moding Codex-hight. Low, thinking. Yeah I know the namning of product and names of the model sucks, that is so confussing, there is codex AI model, there Cloud Codex, Code Agent and much more as well, this is the jus the begining of there stuff.&#x20;

​

But with this release&#x20;

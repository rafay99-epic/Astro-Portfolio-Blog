For what felt like an eternity, my digital life revolved around one constant: **Windows**. From the nostalgic green hills of XP to the familiar tiles of 11, I navigated Microsoft's ecosystem like it was my backyard. Every shortcut, every quirk, every "unexpected error" message – it was home. I was a **Windows** power user, through and through, occasionally peeking at **macOS** on YouTube videos like it was some exotic, unattainable luxury car I'd never get to drive. (Okay, maybe one two-minute joyride on my cousin's Mac, but that barely counts!)

Then came the leap. The big, bold, slightly terrifying jump from my lifelong **Windows** comfort zone straight into the beautifully alien world of **macOS**. Suddenly, my mouse moved *differently*, windows minimized with a graceful (yet confusing!) flourish, and the 'delete' key seemed to have gone on vacation. My muscle memory was having an existential crisis! The visual overhaul alone was enough to make my brain do a double-take.

But here's where my tech story gets really interesting: as a **software engineer** deeply entrenched in the daily grind of Node, React, Flutter, and Laravel, my **operating system** journey didn't stop at just two. Oh no. I've now officially punched my ticket and clocked in significant time on all three major players: **Windows**, **macOS**, and yes, even the glorious, quirky depths of **Linux**. From the polished desktops to the powerful command lines, I've truly lived and coded within each distinct digital universe.

And let me tell you, after navigating the peculiar charms and occasional frustrations of all three, I've gathered some genuinely fascinating (and often hilarious!) insights into their unique personalities. This isn't just a dry **OS comparison**; it's a personal, boots-on-the-ground review from someone who's experienced the full spectrum of **operating systems**. So, if you've ever wondered about the ultimate **Windows vs. Mac vs. Linux** showdown from a hands-on, daily-driver perspective – especially for a fellow tech enthusiast or **software engineer** – you're in for a treat. Let's dive in!

## The Truth

Before we begin with everything here is one thing that I would like to clear something all OS suck. There nothing is perfect so if you think windows is better, linux is better or MacOS is better then F\*\*k off, this is not the place for you.
with all that let's the spanking begining.

## Windows

Oh Windows.. I don't know where to being you have been a pain in my ass for so long, it's so hard to forget the pain, I still get nightware becase of your, wait hours and hours tonhund down each .exe file and wait for flutter sdk to download, I know I have as stong network and still on my machine, any heavy sdk took so long to download.

Not forget the amount of process would kick my a\*\*, I had 16GB of RAM and half was taken my windows. WTf are you doing with 8GB of RAM, the moment, I open an android emulator and VS code puff. I con't open a browser for reading docs. Even with all the debloats and reducing all the processing conts you still sucks, untill I have to icnrease my computer memory to 40GB, Are you kiddy what's wrong with you.

This is just a begining, let's talk about installing applications, the amount of time, I have to go to a different website and hunt down every single .exe file and then play click and click that is f\*\*king useless and not to mension, it's annyoying as well.

Oh the Bloat, it's full so many app that I don't use and if you oh you can install application with winget while on first install winget is broken.. You need to update the winget through the browser which is an .exe file as well, and IF you say use MS Store then please see a doctor,You really need help.

## Linux

Oh linux.. A few years ago when I start using you, I feel like a good, going full nerd on ricking and making power script that would config my laptop with everything I like but then reality hit and Now I bearly used those script, I am at this stage, I don't care about these script, you these script are cool and good but in the long term nope, there is script for evrything from lock screen to lauch any application.

Speaking of Application why the fuck so many way to install an applications, there is package manager, Flatpak , Snap Pack, .deb and AUR, like please for GOD Sake please choose one formate to install application and that is not the best thing, each way of installing application will be on different version so one feature will be on formate and other on another formate. Like Well done, when it comes to installing application you made things more rought, if you want to how many ways are there to isntall applications then check out my [blog](https://www.rafay99.com/).

The good thing about linux is the customization.. Correct....Right??.. while.. in terms of UI, sure but in terms of driver, Please No...I beg you... Sure you can find every driver on linux, trust me, it has made my life so much esy but there is on driver that has drove me to the groud, Any Guess...

....It's Nvidia.. Not to long ago Linus Torvalds to Nvidia: "Fu\*\* You", and when I watch that video I said it won't be that bad but I was wrong... Like really wrong, Nvidia Driver sucks.. if you are on debian then you are doomed, but if you are Linux Mint, Pop OS, Ubuntu then you are good, everything will work so much better these but with Arch linx and any Gendo based distro, the seting up Nvidia Drivers are the worst experience, they will work fine when youa re in laptop mode but the moment you went to the Desktop mode then you are dead, you nvidia driver won't work and put your laptop down in sleep mode.

Like why.. why this happening,

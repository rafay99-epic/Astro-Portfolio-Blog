I still remember it like yesterday. Fresh out of uni, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, an intern wading into the world of Machine Learning because, hey, it was *the* trend. Then, one fateful day, my coworkers dropped a bomb: "Have you seen ChatGPT?" My reaction? Let's just say it was less 'Aha!' and more **"Holy Molly!"**

That first encounter with an AI model generating human-like text, and even *code*, was a revelation. Something so simple, yet so profoundly powerful. My brain immediately zeroed in on the code generation—this was a game-changer. Initially, I was doing what any budding engineer might: copy-pasting snippets from a web browser, hoping for the best. And let's be real, the quality often didn't quite match the hype.

### The Copilot Revelation: Speed Over Polish

Then came GitHub Copilot. For a measly ( $10 ) a month, this thing was a wizard. It wasn't about perfect, pristine code in my region—frankly, nobody here bats an eye at clean code as long as the feature ships and looks good. Simple! The velocity increase Copilot gave me was insane. My sprint demos became smoother, my coffee breaks longer. It just *worked* as a developer productivity powerhouse.

### The AI Arms Race: Claude, Cursor, and Beyond

Just when you thought OpenAI had the entire AI coding kingdom cornered, a new challenger appeared: Anthropic's Claude. It was like watching a tech-themed wrestling match, and suddenly, the ring had more contenders. Then Cursor came along, transforming the coding experience even further. Boom! AI coding assistants were everywhere—from your web browser to every IDE imaginable, all designed to supercharge developer workflow.

To this day, my daily workflow is inseparable from Cursor and T3.chat, leveraging Claude's prowess for coding. They’re just *that* good, especially when you're juggling a Master's degree, research, and daily projects in Node, React, Flutter, and Laravel. It’s a wild ride, and every little bit of automation helps!

### The Grand Experiment: Can AI Build a Full App?

Now, with all that background out of the way, we're at the exciting part. We've seen AI generate snippets, complete functions, and even refactor. But the new frontier, the bold claim echoing across the internet, is "full application development." Can these AI tools truly deliver on that promise? I'm curious, perhaps a little skeptical, but mostly just itching to find out.

### The Rules of Engagement (and Why They Matter)

Before we dive into the code-slinging chaos, we need some ground rules. Think of it as my broke-but-determined approach to tech validation.

1. **Free Tier Only:** Because, let's be real, a software engineer trying to master new tech while also pursuing a Master's degree and engaging in research isn't exactly rolling in cash. Plus, most people start here.
2. **Same Prompt, Every Service:** Fairness is key. We're giving each AI the exact same starting line.
3. **One Chance Only, No Do-Overs:** Just like real-world deadlines (minus the existential dread), what you get is what you get. This also reflects how many users interact with these tools casually.

Why these strict rules? Well, aside from my personal financial situation, it’s about leveling the playing field. Many of these incredible tools often run on the same powerful AI models under the hood—be it Claude, AutoGPT, or a flavor of ChatGPT. It’s a true test of their interface, fine-tuning, and direct applicability for everyday developers like me.

### Our Contenders: The AI Gladiators

What are our contenders in this AI coding showdown? We have a couple of intriguing tools that claim to do it all, from scaffolding to full-app generation:

1. **[Lovable](https://lovable.dev/)**
2. **[Bolt.new](https://bolt.new/)**
3. **[Chef by Convex](https://chef.convex.dev/)**
4. **[Orchids](https://www.orchids.app/)**

### The Gauntlet: Our Ultimate AI Prompt

Now, for the main event! The prompt itself needs to be robust enough to push these tools to their limits, demanding a full-stack (even if local-storage-based) web application, not just a bare-bones script. It's got to be better, right? Here's the precise prompt we'll be throwing at each of these services. May the best AI win!

```
Develop a single-page web application for a minimalist to-do list, focused on user experience and maintainability and with Auth as well.

The application should:
1.  **Frontend Framework:** Utilize a modern JavaScript frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte, or similar) to construct the UI. The choice should reflect current best practices for component-based development.
2.  **Core Features:**
    *   **Add Tasks:** An input field to add new to-do items. Implement client-side input validation to prevent the creation of empty tasks.
    *   **Manage Completion:** Each to-do item should have a way (e.g., a checkbox or toggle button) to mark it as completed or uncompleted. Completed tasks should have a distinct visual style (e.g., strikethrough or faded text).
    *   **Delete Tasks:** A button or icon next to each task to allow users to delete individual to-do items.
3.  **Data Persistence:** All to-do items must be stored in the browser's Local Storage, ensuring data persists across browser sessions. The application should load existing tasks on startup.
4.  **User Interface:**
    *   **Clean & Responsive Design:** Implement a modern, clean, and responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile screens. Basic CSS styling is sufficient, but it should be visually appealing.
    *   **Filtering:** Include basic filtering options (e.g., buttons or tabs) to display "All", "Active", or "Completed" tasks.
    *   **Clear Layout:** Organize the UI with a distinct header, an input section for new tasks, and a clear list display for existing tasks.
5.  **Project Structure & Documentation:**
    *   **Complete Project:** Generate a complete and runnable project directory, including all necessary configuration files (e.g., `package.json`).
    *   **Comprehensive README:** Provide a detailed `README.md` file that clearly outlines:
        *   Required dependencies and environment (e.g., Node.js version, browser compatibility).
        *   Step-by-step installation instructions.
        *   Clear commands to run the application locally.
        *   A brief overview of the key components and overall code structure.
    *   **Code Quality:** Ensure the generated code is well-commented, follows reasonable code best practices for the chosen framework, and is easy to understand.

## Loveable

Love is the one with the most ads on my feed and I have used it and it is good but not too good, there are fews things that are needed to be updated and fixed or imporved upone as well.

The promote is share above but the processing time is good for small application, it took 3 mins to make the application and it's good, the process is detailed and here are the images as you can see

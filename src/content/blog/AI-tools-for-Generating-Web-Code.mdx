I remember the day when chat gpt was trending I did not know and I came in to the office and my Co workers told me about this AI model, It was a new thing for me, I Just completed my University fresh looking for a Job and I was an intern, working on Machine Learning because I could see the trend but never known thing will change so much so fast.

And I tried then chat Gpt model for the first time and I sad **Holy Molly** it was amazing that experience, something so simple and yet so much powerful and I could see it, but one that peek my eye more then anything and that was generating Code Using AI.

Got it.. this is another video where you I will break down each of AI generating Code platform and we will what make them so tick.

When I first try these AI generated code, I was in a web Browser copy and paste and did not know this will set the out did not match the quality but the Github Co-piolet was very different, I paid 10 dollar per month to use this feature becase it speed up so much work for me, and in my region code clean and formate does not matter trust me, No one care about Code clean, all they care about Get the Feature and good Looking. simple

And then Claude Came in place, you see only Open AI was in the lead but Claude and Anthropic Changed the game one more time and then Cursor Came and then Boom.. Vide coding was every where in your web browser to code editior and everything that would speed up a Developer work, Made things so much better. Till this day I use Cursor and T3.chat to Use claude model for coding becase they are too good.

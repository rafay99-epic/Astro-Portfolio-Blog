## The Beginning: My React + Astro Dream Combo

React has always had a soft spot in my dev toolkit. It’s that reliable companion you keep going back to—versatile, powerful, and just fun to work with. Big names like [GitHub](https://github.com), [Netflix](https://netflix.com), and [Meta](https://meta.com) agree, and chances are, if you’ve built something cool lately, React was part of it.

So, when I decided to rebuild my personal site, I knew I wanted the best of both worlds—React’s flexibility with Astro’s insane performance. The result? A site that felt buttery smooth, snappy, and downright slick. Animations glided, the UI was crisp, and everything just... worked. You can check it out here: [rafay99.com](https://rafay99.com)

## But Then... Mobile Happened

On desktop, everything was 💯. But then I tried to show off my site on my phone and—ugh. Animations stuttered. Load times lagged. Something was... off. It wasn’t the masterpiece I had tested and polished for weeks.

I dove straight into dev mode: opened dev tools, replicated the bug, and started slicing through code like a chef on a deadline. My first guess? "Too much JavaScript." So I trimmed, refactored, and optimized the heck out of it. Things improved, yeah—but not enough. There was still this weird sluggishness, like a shadow lurking in the performance.

## The Turning Point: Theo, React-Scan & That 🔥 Video

Stuck in optimization limbo, I turned to the holy land: YouTube. That’s when I stumbled on a video by Theo (yep, [T3.gg](https://t3.gg/)). And man, it cracked the code for me—**React re-render issues**.

Seriously, if you're debugging weird slowdowns in React, just pause and watch this video. It opened my eyes:

That led me to a gem of a tool called **React-Scan**—a visual debugger that literally highlights re-renders on your screen. You can check it out here: [react-scan.com](https://react-scan.com/). It’s one of those “see it to believe it” tools.

## Wait… What Even _Are_ Re-render Issues?

Let’s simplify this. A **re-render** in React is React’s way of keeping the UI in sync with your state or props. That’s normal. But the problem starts when components **re-render unnecessarily**—basically doing work they don’t need to.

You update a tiny bit of state at the top level, and suddenly your whole component tree starts flashing like a Christmas tree. Why? Because React by default will re-render everything downstream.

Here are some common re-render traps:

- **Parent State Changes**: When state changes in a parent, all children re-render—even if they don’t care.
- **Props Identity Changes**: If you're passing down objects or functions inline (like `onClick={() => doThing()}`), React sees a _new_ prop every time. Boom—re-render.
- **Context Updates**: Even a tiny change in context will trigger re-renders in _every_ consuming component.
- **New References**: Arrays, objects, functions—if they’re freshly created in each render, React treats them as “new” even if their values are the same.

And here’s where **React-Scan** blew my mind. Look at this actual screen from my site, showing how many components were re-rendering for no reason:

/>

Wild, right? No wonder mobile was lagging.

## Fixing It: Memoization to the Rescue

Once I pinpointed the issue, it was time to fight back. The quickest win? **`React.memo`**.

It’s a simple wrapper for your components that tells React, “Only re-render this if the props actually change.” Here’s the difference:

### Before Optimization

```jsx
const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [text, setText] = useState("Hello");

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <input value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <ChildComponentA text={text} />
      <ChildComponentB count={count} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

Even changing just the count will re-render both children. Not good.

### After Adding `React.memo`

```jsx
const ChildComponentA = React.memo(({ text }) => {
  console.log("ChildComponentA rendered");
  return <h2>{text}</h2>;
});

const ChildComponentB = React.memo(({ count }) => {
  console.log("ChildComponentB rendered");
  return <h2>Counter: {count}</h2>;
});
```

Now, each child only re-renders if **its** prop changes. Massive improvement.

But keep in mind: `React.memo` only does a shallow comparison. If you're passing objects/functions, use `useMemo` and `useCallback` to keep the reference the same across renders.

## The Future Is Brighter with React 19

React 19 is coming in hot—and it’s fixing a lot of this stuff _for you_. Here’s what’s exciting:

- **Automatic Batching**: React groups multiple state updates into one render. Less waste.
- **Better Memo Defaults**: They're improving how components are memoized behind the scenes.
- **The React Compiler (React Forget)**: This is the real game-changer. It adds memoization at **compile time**. No more wrapping every component in `React.memo` or manually optimizing props. Just write normal code—React will handle the rest.

It’s like having a built-in performance engineer watching your code and doing the hard work for you.

## Wrapping Up: Lessons Learned

This whole journey—from perfect desktop performance to janky mobile issues—was a wake-up call. React performance isn’t just about using fewer libraries or trimming JS. Sometimes, it’s about what’s happening _under the hood_.

What I learned:

- Use tools like **React-Scan** to visualize re-renders.
- Apply `React.memo` smartly.
- Lean on `useMemo` and `useCallback` for reference stability.
- Keep an eye on **React 19**—it’s going to automate a lot of these pain points.

And most importantly? **Test on mobile early.** That’s where performance issues hit hardest.

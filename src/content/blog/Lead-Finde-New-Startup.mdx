If you work in any field, everyone eventually dreams of owning their own business. If you’re a lawyer, you want your own law firm; if you’re a dentist, your own clinic. As software engineers, we’re no different—we’ll all want to build our own SaaS (Software as a Service) at some point. Believe me, I’ve done it twice already. I’ll build something, code for months… and then realize marketing is the less-colorful side of the party.

By now you’re probably wondering: What am I building next? You know me as the “Flutter guy” who builds full-stack apps, but this time I’m going all-in on web tech—and boy, do I have stories for you.

Buckle up, nerds… this is going to be a wild ride. I’ll be posting my journey every single day as I add features, squash bugs, and push updates to production. If you’re impatient, though, go ahead and check out v0.2 of the app—it’s live now at [https://www.leadfinder.store/](https://www.leadfinder.store/).

Before you grab your keyboard to drop comments, let me explain the name and the core idea behind the product.

## Lead Finder

As the name suggests, Lead Finder is a platform that helps you discover business leads for any line of work. Imagine you just graduated from university and you’re hunting for an internship. You scroll through social media, sometimes spotting opportunities, sometimes hitting dead ends. It gets rough.

Maybe you’re a freelancer, or a doctor looking for patients. Gathering all that data and dumping it into a spreadsheet feels outdated and tedious. And spreadsheets go stale fast—leads change, companies pivot, contact info shifts.

You need a service that keeps things moving and surfaces the best leads for your field. Whether you’re a software developer, a law firm, a hospital—or anything in between—Lead Finder delivers fresh, actionable contacts right to your fingertips with a single click. That’s the power of this SaaS.

## Back Story

The back story is very simple, I am a free lancer most of the time and I want to find lead using the internet, it was hard, going to different ites, search the thing, wrote down all the email, phone numbers and other into a excel sheet and then few time later all the data is out data so I though why not just I buid this stuff. it won't tak that long, so I made quick react project, install the depiedences and then make basic UI and then I intergrated the api, I added the export all the data into a simple excel sheet and then bam, i have all the data, it was so simple and clean but then a thought hit my mind, If i am having this issue then other might be facing the same thing so I asked around in my community and I found out yeah, this is a problem and where their a problem, I have a solution and I asked chatgpt about this and he helped me push thing much better as well.

## The Begining

At the start I only, I only have three feature in mind.

Not too long ago when Claude 4 was annocuned all news where on a new protrol called MCP server, it ws cool but at that time, I say it is cool but nothing serious, while moves on and after some time like a couple of months, MCP is every where, from context awaness, to tool calling, and much more. every tool you know on the internet has an MCP server, from figma. to github, google chrome dev tools, Notion, obsidia, claud code, reading docs with astro and much more.

With the hype in mid, I want to try the MCP Server, I want to see can it really help me out with some kind of automation, or help me code as well, Here is the thing, I hate coding UI, there are the most fruteless and useless thing in my mind but people looks at the UI, so I want to try fima MCP server to code a new UI.. that is cool.. right.

but this is just tip, I have head that I can use custom MCP that you can use and you can use docker and not replay on the internet which I want to do.

> All the code and product I use, I am on free version, Claude Free, docker free the only paid software is Cursor which is free and MCP is not a paid feature.

so With the diclamair is out of way, Now let's check the doc from figma, How can I set up a MCP server with Cursor, and make a simple UI, it's going to be very simple, I will be using figma desktop on my local machine

This is the figma design that I ramdom pick up from the community

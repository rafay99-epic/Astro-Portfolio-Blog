Just when you thought your `node_modules` folder couldn't get any bigger, or your `.dotfiles` couldn't get any more complex, Amazon drops a new challenger into the code editor arena: meet **Kiro**! My immediate thought? "Do I *really* need another editor?" (Spoiler: For a software engineer, the answer is almost always a resounding "yes, just to try it!")

It was yesterday, or perhaps the day before (time flies when you're debugging!), when a tweet `console.log()`-ed itself directly into my feed: Amazon had launched a brand-new code editor. And the name? **Kiro**. Seriously, how cool is that? It just *sounds* like it belongs in your dev environment.

At the time, I was happily neck-deep in a Next.js application, implementing a full-blown blog system for a client using my trusty Cursor. My dev flow was smooth, components were rendering, and life was good. But as any curious engineer knows, a new tool on the block is like an unmerged `feature` branch – you just *have* to check it out.

So, I did what any self-respecting tech enthusiast would do: I paused my current task (because, priorities!), closed Cursor, and fired up my browser. A quick Google search for "Amazon code editor" and boom, the first result was the official link. The best part? It's free to download, and available for Mac, Windows, and Linux! As a Windows user, I was thrilled; new toys to play with and, of course, fresh content ideas to spark!

Installation was a breeze. Upon launching Kiro, it smoothly prompted me to sign in with GitHub, followed by an option to import settings from VS Code. This, my friend, was a `git merge` I didn't know I needed! I hit "confirm," and Kiro started pulling in all my beloved config, extensions, and aesthetic preferences.

Now, I won't lie, the transfer felt like compiling `node_modules` from scratch – it took a *while*. But hey, good things come to those who wait (or whose `package.json` resolves successfully!). Once it was done, I reopened my Next.js project in Kiro, and everything just… clicked. It looked familiar, yet somehow, it felt refreshed. All my preferred settings were there, making the transition feel less like a context switch and more like an optimized `hot-reload`.

But here's the kicker, the `if/else` statement that truly defines Kiro: While it has that comforting VS Code vibe, there are some distinct differences that set it apart. And that, my fellow coders, is where the real fun begins.

## Two Mode

Kira has two modes when you launch a project

1. Vibe Coding Mode
2. Sepc Mode

Both modes are so different and yet so similar here what it look like when you open a project in **Kiro.**

 ![](/BlogImages/kiro_interface.webp)Now the UI shows use which mode to show but with this, let me talk about the coding experience with these new modes. 

## Vibe Coding Mode

Form their names, you can guess what these this will take input from the user, index the code base and make the changes to the code base as well. and then let user know about the changes if approve then it will set all the changes, It will create a seperate Review screen something like this ![](/BlogImages/review_screen.webp)

Now you can see I am doing some testing and it will create demo file and the code and then you approve and then it will make the changes to the file, I really like the porcess of revert in the chatbot, this was look so if something  I don't like then I can just get rid all of the changes 

## Spec Mode

So this mode is very different, what this model really

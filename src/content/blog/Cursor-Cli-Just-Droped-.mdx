With the release of GPT 5  from OpenAI there are lot of tools which are getting major update and out of these there was one surpises me, that was Cursor CLI, I am not sure about these kind of tools but I have seen on twitter there is alot of tools like this, Google Gemni Tool, Claude Code, OpenCLI and Wrap Terminal and now Cursor has joined the league and today blog post is very simple we are going cursor cli, on an application that my office and my team will be using in the future.

Okay before we being with the coding, let's beging with understanding the code and the problem we are trying to solve.

I have a project with convex and I don't want a cloud base operation that would break alot of things, I want a simple local solution where I will enter email or user id and I will get the result. So to solve this I have build a simple python application with three major compoents.

1. Load Data Folder
2. Enter User Email or User ID
3. Then display the user data
   1. Such as user information
   2. Ranking
   3. referal Points History
   4. Application tracking application

Simple and Clean Process.

## The Terminal

For this Coding session, we will going full vibe code using cursor cli with GPT-5 model, I have heard so much from this model in terms of coding but I want to test how this will last and how this will effect the code base.

One more thing, I will be creating a branch and if it breaks then I will revert to the main branch.

There’s a certain kind of magic when your terminal stops being a passive black box and starts actively helping you write, refactor, and commit code.\
With the release of **GPT‑5** from OpenAI, we’ve seen a wave of AI-powered developer tools getting major updates — **Google Gemini CLI**, **Claude Code**, **OpenCLI**, **Warp Terminal** — and now **Cursor CLI** has joined the league.

I’ve been seeing Cursor CLI pop up all over Twitter, and I’ll admit, I wasn’t sure if it was just another AI gimmick. But curiosity won. I decided to test it on a **real project** my team will actually use in production.

## The Problem I Wanted to Solve

I have a **Convex**-based project, but I don’t want to rely on cloud-based operations for certain lookups. Too many dependencies, too many ways for things to break.

Instead, I wanted a **local-first Python application** where I could:

1. **Load a Data Folder** (local dataset)
2. **Enter a User Email or User ID**
3. **Display the User Data**, including:
   * User Information
   * Ranking
   * Referral Points History
   * Application Tracking Progress

The goal was a **simple, clean, and reliable process** — no cloud calls, no external dependencies that could fail at the wrong time.

## The Terminal Setup

For this coding session, I went **full vibe mode** — running **Cursor CLI** inside **Warp Terminal** with the **GPT‑5 model**.\
No IDE, no VS Code, just me, the terminal, and an AI that could read, modify, and commit code.

To be safe, I created a **new branch**. If things went sideways, I could revert to `main` and pretend nothing happened.

## The Original Limitation

The application worked, but the **Profile View** section’s *Referral History* was just plain text. It was functional, but not exactly user-friendly.

I wanted to:

* Make the data **readable and visually appealing**
* Add **tables, charts, and modern UI styling**
* Keep everything **local and lightweight**

## What I Added During the Session

With Cursor CLI acting as my AI pair programmer, here’s what I implemented:

1. **Database Memory** — The app now remembers the last loaded dataset for faster reloads.
2. **Upload Dataset** — Added a clean interface for importing new datasets.
3. **Reset Old Dataset** — One-click reset to clear previous data.
4. **New User Profile Creation** — Ability to add new users directly from the app.
5. **PDF Export Support** — Export user profiles, rankings, and history as PDF reports.
6. **Multiple Window Support** — Open different sections of the app in separate windows.
7. **Build Scripts for Mac and Windows** — Easy packaging for cross-platform distribution.
8. **App Bar with Exit and About Section** — A proper application feel with navigation and info.

## How Cursor CLI + GPT‑5 Helped

Here’s where Cursor CLI really impressed me:

* **Understanding the Codebase** — It scanned my `data_loader.py` and `utils.py` to understand how history entries were structured before making changes.
* **UI Overhaul** — It replaced raw text with **sortable tables**, **charts**, and **color-coded highlights**.
* **Error Prevention** — It compiled the Python files to check for syntax errors before committing.
* **Clean Commits** — It staged only the relevant changes and wrote clear, professional commit messages.

Example commit message it generated:

> Profile: Replace plain text history with tables, charts, and details. Introduce sortable tables and visualizations for Referral History, Points History, Mini Game Progress, and Wake-up Pings.

## The Experience

Using Cursor CLI felt less like using an autocomplete tool and more like **pair programming with a junior developer who’s fast, careful, and occasionally paranoid**.

At one point, it asked:

> "Run this command? Not in allowlist: python"

It’s like having a teammate who says, *"I can run it for you… but only if you promise it won’t blow up the server."*

## Why This Matters

For developers working on **local-first applications**, **data visualization tools**, or **internal utilities**, AI-powered CLI tools like Cursor CLI can:

* Speed up UI improvements
* Automate repetitive coding tasks
* Keep commits clean and organized
* Reduce the risk of introducing errors during refactors

## Final Thoughts

This wasn’t just AI writing code — it was **AI collaborating on a real feature set**.\
In one session, I went from a functional but plain Python app to a **multi-window, export-capable, visually polished tool** ready for my team to use.

Would I trust Cursor CLI with my entire production codebase? Not yet.\
Would I use it for **feature branches, rapid prototyping, and UI overhauls**? Absolutely.

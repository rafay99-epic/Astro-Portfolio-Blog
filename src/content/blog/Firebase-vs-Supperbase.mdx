The world is evolving rapidly with AI and new technologies reshaping how we build apps. As a fresh developer, you're faced with one big question: **Which backend should you choose?**

With so many options—Firebase, Supabase, PocketBase, Appwrite, and more—it can be overwhelming to decide. Each service promises speed, scalability, and ease of use, but which one truly fits your needs?

To find out, I built two real-world apps: **Meaning Mate (powered by Firebase)** and **WallZen (built with Supabase)**. Through these projects, I'll break down the pros and cons of each platform, helping you make an informed decision.

Let’s dive in!

## TL;DR

Picking a backend can be overwhelming with so many choices. That’s where **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)** comes in—it handles all the backend stuff (databases, auth, cloud functions) so you can focus on building your app.

- **Firebase** – Google’s BaaS with real-time databases, authentication, and cloud functions. Super easy to use, great for fast development.
- **Supabase** – The open-source alternative to Firebase, powered by PostgreSQL. More control, SQL support, and still packed with real-time features.

Now, let’s compare Firebase and Supabase to see which one actually works best!

## What Do You Get for Free?

As a new dev, you want the best free stuff—something that lets you build without hitting a paywall too soon. So, let’s talk about what you actually get for free.

- **Firebase Free Plan:**
  - Firestore with **1 GB of storage**
  - Decent read/write limits
  - Authentication for **up to 10,000 users per month**
  - Basic hosting with **10 GB of bandwidth**
  - **No more free cloud functions or storage** 😢
- **Supabase Free Plan:**
  - PostgreSQL database with **500 MB of storage**
  - Authentication for **up to 50,000 users**
  - **1 GB of file storage**
  - **5 GB of bandwidth**
  - **No free hosting & inactive projects get paused after a week**

Both platforms have trade-offs, but which one fits your needs better? Let's break it down.

## The Setup Experience

### Firebase

Firebase provides built-in functions and an SDK, making integration super easy. You just need to install the Firebase CLI, create a project, and configure your Flutter app with a simple command.

#### My Experience with Firebase Setup

Setting up Firebase was straightforward. The documentation is clear, and there are plenty of guides available online. However, when I ran into an issue with authentication, I found myself sifting through a ton of Stack Overflow answers to find the right fix. One thing I appreciated was how Firebase handles SDK integration—it’s smooth and well-optimized for Flutter apps.

```dart
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  try {
    await Firebase.initializeApp();
    runApp(const MyApp());
  } catch (e) {
    runApp(ErrorApp(errorMessage: e.toString()));
  }
}
```

### Supabase

Supabase is just as easy. You install the Flutter package, import it, and pass in your API keys—no CLI required!

#### My Experience with Supabase Setup

Unlike Firebase, Supabase does not require CLI configuration, which I found refreshing. However, since Supabase is newer, finding answers when I ran into an API key issue was a struggle. The documentation is helpful, but not as in-depth as Firebase’s.

```dart
await Supabase.initialize(
  url: dotenv.env['SUPABASE_URL']!,
  anonKey: dotenv.env['SUPABASE_ANON_KEY']!,
);
```

Both are easy to set up, but the real challenge isn't the setup—it’s **finding the right information when things go wrong.**

## The Problem: Availability of Information

Firebase has been around for years, meaning you’ll find tons of guides, tutorials, and videos. Supabase? Not so much. There’s some content, but nowhere near as much as Firebase.

As a new dev, you rely on documentation, but it doesn’t always cover every edge case. When you get stuck, finding help can be frustrating. If AI can’t help, you’re in trouble.

## The Database: Firestore vs. PostgreSQL

- **Firebase (Firestore)** – A NoSQL, document-based database
- **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** – A relational database

**Key takeaway:** It doesn’t matter where you store your data—**if you don’t structure it properly, you’re doomed.**

For example:

- **Meaning Mate (Firebase):** Stored user documents along with AI limits and message quotas.
- **WallZen (Supabase):** Tracked which users downloaded which images and how many times.

The complexity was manageable in both cases, but in the end, **your database structure matters more than your choice of database.**

## Authentication

### Firebase Authentication

Firebase authentication is well-documented and widely used. I set up an `AuthRepository` class to handle authentication:

```typescript
class AuthRepository {
  private auth = firebase.auth();

  async signUp(email: string, password: string) {
    const userCredential = await this.auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(
      email,
      password,
    );
    return userCredential.user;
  }
}
```

### Supabase Authentication

Supabase authentication is just as simple. The main difference? **Google Sign-In requires different tokens for web and mobile**, which can be tricky at first but is easy once set up.

## Storage: Firebase vs. Supabase

If your app uses images or videos, storage matters.

- Firebase **used to** offer **5GB free storage**, but not anymore.
- Supabase **still offers** **5GB free storage**.

For image-heavy apps like **WallZen**, **Supabase is the clear winner**.

## Conclusion: Which One Should You Pick?

So, which one is better? Well, it depends on your needs.

| Feature                       | Firebase                                    | Supabase                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Ease of Use**               | ✅ Very easy                                | ✅ Easy                      |
| **Free Tier**                 | ✅ Generous, but no free cloud functions    | ✅ More free storage & auth  |
| **Database**                  | 🔹 NoSQL (Firestore)                        | 🔹 SQL (PostgreSQL)          |
| **Documentation & Community** | ✅ Huge                                     | ❌ Still growing             |
| **Best For**                  | 🚀 Fast development, small to mid-size apps | 🏗️ Scalable apps, SQL lovers |

### My Verdict

- If you're building a quick MVP or small app? **Go with Firebase.**
- Need more control & SQL? **Supabase is the better choice.**

At the end of the day, **both are solid choices**. Pick the one that best fits your project and coding style.

So, which one will you choose? Let me know in the comments!

Until then, peace out, nerds. 💕

The world is evolving rapidly with the rise of AI and countless new technologies. As a fresh developer, you’re faced with one big question: Which backend should you choose?

With so many options—Firebase, Supabase, PocketBase, Appwrite, and more—it can be overwhelming to decide. Each service promises speed, scalability, and ease of use, but which one truly fits your needs?

In this blog, we’ll dive deep into two popular choices: Firebase and Supabase. To put them to the test, I built two apps—Meaning Mate (powered by Firebase) and WallZen (built with Supabase).

Through these real-world projects, I’ll break down the pros and cons of each platform, helping you make an informed decision.

Let’s explore what makes these backends unique! 🚀

### TL;DR

Picking a backend can be overwhelming with so many choices out there. That’s where Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) comes in—it handles all the backend stuff (databases, auth, cloud functions) so you can just focus on building your app.

🔥 Firebase – Google’s BaaS with real-time databases, authentication, and cloud functions. Super easy to use, great for fast development.

⚡ Supabase – The open-source alternative to Firebase, powered by PostgreSQL. More control, SQL support, and still packed with real-time features.

Now, let’s dive into Firebase vs. Supabase and see which one actually works best!

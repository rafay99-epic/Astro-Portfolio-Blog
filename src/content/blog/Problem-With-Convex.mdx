**Ah yes, Convex.** The backend equivalent of sliced bread—at least according to the tech hype machine. You’ve seen it. YouTube tutorials swooning. X (formerly Twitter) threads declaring it the One True BaaS™ for web and AI alike. Blog posts throwing around words like *"game-changer"* and *"magic"*. So, naturally, when I landed a shiny new gig as a Full-Stack Software Engineer and got the task of building an onboarding flow, I thought: **"Why not lean into the hype?"**

So I did.

I spun up a nice little Next.js frontend, connected it with Convex for the backend, tossed Clerk into the mix for authentication, and let my AI copilots help with the heavy lifting. Fast-forward a few hours and a few too many coffees, and what I had was a codebase so pristine it could hang in a modern art museum. Every mutation lived in its own file. The UI clicked at endpoints like clockwork.

**Piece of cake, right?**

**HAHAHA.**
(*Cue the screaming.*)

## The Calm Before the Storm

I presented the app to my manager. The response? “Wow, this is great!”
Everyone loved the sleek dashboard and smooth UX. We made a few tweaks, but nothing major. The vibe was optimistic.

Then came **July 20th, 2025 at 12 AM**—deployment time. And you know what? Everything actually worked. For a few days.

In just 12 hours, **200 users signed up.**
I watched the data stream in, jaw on the floor. It was like watching fireworks on New Year’s—except these fireworks were my backend APIs exploding in real-time.

## The Happy Story Ends

Traffic kept climbing. 500+ users online at once.
And then… the issues began.

### The Problem:

Client-side errors. Performance drops. Broken components.

But here's the kicker:
**No errors in the logs. Zero. Nada.**
The system *looked* fine, but it was slowly dying inside.

So, I did what any engineer would do—meetings, debugging, late-night Slack rants, and more debugging.

Eventually, the culprit revealed itself:

> **Convex cache was hitting max capacity. Constantly.**
> And once it hit 100%, the application just... broke.

## The Original Code: What Went Wrong?

Here’s the original `getLeaderboard` function that led us down this rabbit hole:

```ts
export const getLeaderboard = query({
  args: {
    limit: v.number(),
    skip: v.number(),
    country: v.optional(v.string()),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const maxProcessLimit = 1000;
    const processingLimit = Math.min(args.limit + args.skip + 100, maxProcessLimit);

    let query = ctx.db.query("users");

    if (args.country) {
      query = query.filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("country"), args.country));
    }

    const users = await query.take(processingLimit);

    const sortedUsers = users
      .map((user) => ({
        userId: user.userId,
        name: user.name,
        profileImage: user.profileImage,
        country: user.country,
        totalPoints: Object.values(user.pointsBreakdown).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0),
        directReferralCount: user.directReferralCount,
      }))
      .sort(
        (a, b) =>
          b.totalPoints - a.totalPoints ||
          b.directReferralCount - a.directReferralCount
      )
      .slice(args.skip, args.skip + args.limit);

    const totalUsers = await ctx.db.query("users").collect();
    const totalCount = args.country
      ? totalUsers.filter(u => u.country === args.country).length
      : totalUsers.length;

    return {
      leaderboard: sortedUsers,
      total: Math.min(totalCount, maxProcessLimit),
      hasMore: args.skip + args.limit < Math.min(totalCount, maxProcessLimit),
      pagination: {
        limit: args.limit,
        skip: args.skip,
        nextSkip: args.skip + args.limit < totalCount ? args.skip + args.limit : null,
      },
    };
  },
});
```

This code worked beautifully—for a demo. But in production, with real traffic? Not so much.

### Why it failed:

* **`collect()` pulls *everything* into memory.** That’s like trying to drink from a firehose because you're a little thirsty.
* **No pagination safeguards.**
* **Heavy client-side computation.**
* **No caching optimization.**

## The Rewrite: Optimized and Cache-Friendly

So I rewrote the function. Introducing the **new and improved** `getLeaderboard`:

```ts
export const getLeaderboard = query({
  args: {
    limit: v.number(),
    skip: v.number(),
    country: v.optional(v.string()),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const safeLimit = Math.min(args.limit, 50);
    const safeSkip = Math.max(0, args.skip);

    // Try to get precomputed leaderboard first
    const precomputed = await ctx.db
      .query("precomputedStats")
      .withIndex("by_type_country", (q) =>
        q.eq("statType", "leaderboard").eq("country", args.country || "global")
      )
      .first();

    if (precomputed && Date.now() - precomputed.updatedAt < 300000) {
      const data = precomputed.data as any[];
      const sliced = data.slice(safeSkip, safeSkip + safeLimit);

      return {
        leaderboard: sliced,
        total: data.length,
        hasMore: safeSkip + safeLimit < data.length,
        pagination: {
          limit: safeLimit,
          skip: safeSkip,
          nextSkip: safeSkip + safeLimit < data.length ? safeSkip + safeLimit : null,
        },
        fromCache: true,
      };
    }

    // Fallback: Live DB fetch with index
    let query = ctx.db.query("users").withIndex("by_createdAt");

    if (args.country) {
      query = query.filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("country"), args.country));
    }

    const fetchLimit = Math.min(safeLimit + safeSkip + 20, 100);
    const users = await query.take(fetchLimit);

    const processedUsers = users
      .filter(user => !user.email.startsWith("DEACTIVATED_"))
      .map((user) => ({
        userId: user.userId,
        name: user.name,
        profileImage: user.profileImage,
        country: user.country,
        totalPoints: Object.values(user.pointsBreakdown).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0),
        directReferralCount: user.directReferralCount,
      }))
      .sort((a, b) => b.totalPoints - a.totalPoints || b.directReferralCount - a.directReferralCount);

    const sliced = processedUsers.slice(safeSkip, safeSkip + safeLimit);

    return {
      leaderboard: sliced,
      total: processedUsers.length,
      hasMore: safeSkip + safeLimit < processedUsers.length,
      pagination: {
        limit: safeLimit,
        skip: safeSkip,
        nextSkip: safeSkip + safeLimit < processedUsers.length ? safeSkip + safeLimit : null,
      },
      fromCache: false,
    };
  },
});
```

## Why This Works Better:

✅ **Safe pagination with hard limits**
✅ **Precomputed leaderboard support (with 5-minute TTL)**
✅ **No `collect()`—goodbye memory blowups**
✅ **Index-based querying**
✅ **Filters deactivated users**
✅ **Graceful fallback logic**

But even with all these improvements… the question remains:

> **How much can you actually cache before you need to refresh it?**

Spoiler: A *lot*, but not everything. And certainly not forever.

## The Real Pain

This was *one* function.
I’ve got dozens more: `completeMiniGame`, `getAllUsers`, etc.—all screaming for optimization and cache sanity.

And the worst part? **Support is… nonexistent.**
I’ve reached out on Discord. Sent emails. Nothing. I’m hoping someone from the Convex team sees this before I end up migrating the entire backend to something else.

## In Conclusion…

I’m still grinding away at this.
Still caching. Still querying. Still debugging.

But here’s the thing:

**Convex *is* good.**
The folks who built it? Yeah, they helped scale Discord. That’s no small feat.
This isn’t some random weekend project—it’s a serious, ambitious backend platform designed for modern apps.

But here’s the catch:

> It *looks* simple. It *feels* magical. But **it’s not easy.**

If you're going to build with Convex, **you need to understand how it works under the hood.**
One wrong use of `collect()`, a careless `args{}` structure, or an unoptimized query—and boom, you're stuck in debug purgatory like I was.

So, here’s my warning wrapped in love:

> **Convex is amazing—but not for noobs.**

It’s a journey. One that rewards performance-focused devs who care about architecture.
And if you're coming from the land of classic SQL with **PlanetScale** or **Microsoft SQL Server**, you’ll feel the difference. Those platforms are built like tanks. Convex is more like a spaceship—you need to know what every button does before you launch.

So yes—use Convex. But use it wisely.

Until then...

**Keep coding, nerds. Optimize everything. And may your cache never overflow.**

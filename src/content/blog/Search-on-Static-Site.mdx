During my time as a developer, there is one feature that is truly nightmare to setup and it this features varies from one one Project to another and not just Project but even Project static.
Thankfully, Current web used some kind of Framwork to develop full stack application and the base for this Project is all ways React or React based framwork.

This feature is called Search,Searching the a website and making sure the content that you are find is searchable and the end user can find the content they are trying to find, otherwise this feature is useless.

# What is React?

The main question that comes to the mind is, what is react and what is JavaScript. and how this thing can help me make a search feature on a site.

React is a web framework that is developed by Meta or Facebook. React is a UI libiary that helpes developer to create cool looking website using JavaScript and NodeJs.

# Let's get started

With that clear, let's get in the down how can we create a search feature. First ytou need some content on your site and for this I use astro, I have alot of content that is written in markdown and I build my website using the Astro Framwork.

Astro is a JavaScript framwork just like react but wit just one goal in mind, Make content driven site much easer to build and very fast.

For this example, I will be creating a Astro Project and then we build the search Feature from that.

## Creating Astro Project.

In order toc ereate a Project in astro you need to enter these command

```astro
npm create astro@latest
```

what command will do, it will ask some question, answer them and you will have a workable react Project.
This commadn will also ask for a starting tempate and I would recommand to start with a Blog Template because, it will make life so much easier.

The starter Templates adds alot of features that you don't need to config. FGor more information you can checkout astro office Documentation], by [clicking here](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/1-setup/2/)

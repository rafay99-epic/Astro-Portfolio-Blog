Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using **https://rafay99.com** (the "Website").

By accessing or using this Website, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Website.

### 1. Who I Am

This Website is owned and operated by Abdul Rafay, a software developer based in Pakistan. You can reach me at [99marafay@gmail.com](mailto:99marafay@gmail.com). Throughout these Terms, references to "I," "me," "we," or "our" refer to Abdul Rafay.

### 2. Use of the Website

You may use this Website for lawful purposes only. You agree not to attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Website or its infrastructure; copy, scrape, or redistribute content without permission; use the Website in any way that could harm its performance, security, or availability; or misrepresent your identity or intentions when contacting me. I reserve the right to restrict or block access if misuse is detected.

### 3. Content and Intellectual Property

Unless stated otherwise, all content on this Website—including blogs, text, code snippets, design, and branding—is owned by me and protected by applicable copyright and intellectual property laws. You are welcome to share blog links, quote short excerpts with clear attribution and a link back, or tweet and reference my content. However, you may not republish full articles without permission, sell or repackage my content, or claim my work as your own. If you wish to reuse content beyond fair use, simply email me—I am generally reasonable about such requests.

### 4. Blog and Educational Content Disclaimer

Any content published on this Website, including blogs, tutorials, or code examples, is provided for educational and informational purposes only and does not constitute professional, legal, or financial advice. Content may become outdated over time, and you bear full responsibility for how you apply any information obtained from this Website.

### 5. Hiring Me / Professional Services

This Website allows you to contact me for freelance, consulting, or development work. Contacting me does not, by itself, create a binding contract. Any work agreement will be defined separately through email correspondence, a formal proposal, or a signed contract. Timelines, pricing, scope, and deliverables must be explicitly agreed upon before work commences. I do not guarantee specific business results, revenue, or performance outcomes from my services. Until a separate agreement exists, no professional obligations are formed.

### 6. Third-Party Links and Services

This Website may contain links to third-party websites or services, including tools, platforms, and social media. I do not control these third-party sites and am not responsible for their content, availability, or practices. Your interaction with third-party services is entirely at your own risk, and you should review their terms and privacy policies independently.

### 7. Analytics, Ads, and Privacy

Use of this Website is also governed by my [Privacy Policy](https://www.rafay99.com/privacy-policy). Analytics and advertisements are enabled only with user consent, and data processing practices are explained in detail in the Privacy Policy. I respect GDPR and similar regulations where applicable.

### 8. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, I am not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Website. I am not responsible for data loss, downtime, or errors. The Website is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind. While I will make reasonable efforts to fix issues if something breaks, I cannot promise perfection.

### 9. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold me harmless from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your misuse of the Website, your violation of these Terms, or your infringement of any third-party rights.

### 10. Termination

I may suspend or terminate your access to the Website at any time if you violate these Terms, if misuse or abuse is detected, or if required by law.

### 11. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of **Pakistan**, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.

### 12. Changes to These Terms

I may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page, and the "Last updated" date will reflect the latest revision. Continued use of the Website after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.

### 13. Contact

If you have questions about these Terms, you can reach me at [99marafay@gmail.com](mailto:99marafay@gmail.com) or through the contact page at [https://www.rafay99.com/contact-me](https://www.rafay99.com/contact-me).

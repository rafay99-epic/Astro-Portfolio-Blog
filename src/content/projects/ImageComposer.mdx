## Development Process

### Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular, component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
│   ├── image-composer/  # Image compression feature
│   ├── image-enhancer/  # Image enhancement feature
│   └── ui/             # Base UI components
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── lib/                # Core business logic
├── pages/              # Route components
├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
└── utils/              # Utility functions
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Feature Development**: Each feature is developed as a separate module with its own components, hooks, and utilities
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript implementation ensures code reliability
3. **Component Reusability**: Shared components and hooks promote code reuse
4. **Testing**: Manual testing across different browsers and devices
5. **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading, code splitting, and efficient algorithms

### Code Quality Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking enabled
- **ESLint**: Enforced code style and best practices

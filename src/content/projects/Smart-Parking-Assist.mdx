# Smart Parking Assistant ‚Äî A Real-Time IoT-Based Parking Management System üöóüì°

In today's urban landscape, parking remains a major headache for both drivers and city administrators. From wasting time circling for spots to inefficient use of available space, the problem demands a smart solution. That's where **Parking Assistant**, an IoT-powered project developed by me, steps in.

This blog post will walk you through what the project is, what problem it solves, how it's built, and how you can run it yourself.

---

## üöò What is Parking Assistant?

**Parking Assistant** is a smart system designed to **detect real-time parking availability** using IR sensors, and visualize it through a responsive web interface. It not only detects vacant or occupied spots but also includes a **reservation system**, giving users the ability to book their parking in advance.

The system consists of:

- **A user-friendly website** for drivers.
- **A manager/admin dashboard** to monitor and manage parking data.
- **Hardware sensors** connected to an Arduino UNO to detect car presence.
- **A Node.js backend** to bridge the communication between hardware and website using serial communication.

---

## üéØ The Problem We're Solving

In congested cities, drivers spend up to **30% of their driving time** looking for parking. This results in:

- Wasted time and fuel.
- Increased traffic congestion.
- CO2 emissions.

Traditional parking systems are either manual or rely on expensive smart meters. **Parking Assistant provides a low-cost, scalable solution** using simple IR sensors and open-source technologies.

## üíª Software Prerequisites

To run the project, install the following:

1. [XAMPP](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/tools/xampp-tutorial-create-your-own-local-test-server/)
2. [Node.js](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/windows/node-windows.html)
3. [VS Code](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/install-visual-studio-code-fe3908c5cf15)
4. [Arduino IDE](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/arduino/arduino_installation.htm)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up the Hardware

You'll need to wire up the sensors as follows:

- Each IR sensor has **three pins**: VCC (Power), GND (Ground), OUT (Data).
- Connect them to the Arduino UNO using jumper wires and a breadboard.
- Use the **5V pin** from Arduino to power the sensors.
- Connect the Arduino to your PC via USB and upload the sensor code from the repo.

The IR sensors will then detect whether a car is present or not and send that signal through the serial port to the Node.js server.

---

## üåê Connecting Hardware to Web Interface

Arduino alone cannot talk to a website, so we built a **Node.js server** that:

- Listens to serial data from Arduino.
- Uses **Socket.IO** to send that data in real-time to the web client.
- The server runs on port **3000**.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Setting Up the Database

1. Open XAMPP Control Panel and start **Apache** and **MySQL**.
2. Navigate to `localhost/phpmyadmin`.
3. Create a database named `parking_data`.
4. Import the SQL file found in the repo at `Manager-Website/database/parking_data.sql`.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### Step-by-step:

1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Open the folder in **VS Code**.
3. Run the following commands in the terminal:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

4. Visit `localhost:5000` to view the website.
5. Make sure the Arduino is connected and sending data.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The app will crash if hardware is not connected. Ensure the correct serial port is defined in `app.js`.

Also, install the [CORS Unblock extension](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cors-unblock/hkjklmhkbkdhlgnnfbbcihcajofmjgbh) for Edge to avoid CORS issues during development.

## üìç Real-Time Updates

Once the setup is complete, the system will:

- Detect available or occupied parking spaces via IR sensors.
- Display the real-time status on the web interface.
- Allow users to reserve spots ahead of time.

## üéØ Final Thoughts

**Parking Assistant** is a practical demonstration of combining **IoT with web development** to solve real-world problems. It's a great project for learning how hardware communicates with software and how real-time data can be visualized effectively on the web.

Whether you're a developer, student, or urban planner, this project is a great starting point for building smarter cities.

# MS Bridge

MS Bridge is a cross-platform mobile application built with Flutter, designed for seamless lecture note reading and note-taking. It supports both online and offline modes, allowing users to effortlessly switch between them manually or automatically based on network availability.

The app integrates Firebase for authentication, real-time data synchronization, and an admin panel, ensuring secure and efficient note management. For offline access, it utilizes Hive as a robust local storage solution, enabling users to read and manage their notes anytime, anywhere.

With MS Bridge, you get a reliable, user-friendly platform for organizing and accessing your study materials without interruptions.

## Features

- **Dynamic Note Rendering** – Fetches and displays your notes from an API endpoint, ensuring you always have the latest version.
- **Online/Offline Mode** – Seamlessly switches between online and offline modes, allowing you to access your notes even without an internet connection.
- **Local Database with Hive** – Utilizes Hive, a fast and lightweight NoSQL database, for efficient offline data storage and retrieval.
- **Secure Authentication and Spam Detection** – Implements Firebase Authentication for secure user access and incorporates spam detection mechanisms to maintain data integrity.
- **Fast Search and Tag System** – Includes a powerful search functionality and a tag system for quick and easy note organization and retrieval.
- **Admin Panel Integration** – Allows seamless integration with CMS through the web view, so you can manage content via CMS from anywhere.
- **Note-Taking** – Enables users to create, edit, and delete notes, providing a comprehensive note-taking experience with Hive as the local database.
- **Multiple Theme Support** – Users can switch between various themes, including light mode, dark mode, sunset, midnight, forest green, and more, allowing for a personalized experience.
- **Fast Search** – With Hive database support, searching is optimized for speed and efficiency, enabling case-insensitive searches across titles and content.
- **Enhanced Offline Mode** – Automatically switches between online and offline modes, preventing changes when there is no internet connection.
- **Reset to Default** – Provides an option to reset settings and themes back to the default style whenever needed.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter (Version 3.22.2):** The primary framework for building the user interface and application logic.
- **Firebase:**
  - Authentication: For user account management and secure access.
  - Realtime Database / Firestore (Specify which one you are using): For data storage and synchronization.
  - Web Hosting or App hosting: For hosting CMS.
- **Hive:** A lightweight NoSQL database for local data storage.
- **API Calls:** Flutter's `http` package (or similar) for fetching notes from the backend API.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to set up and run MS Bridge on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (Version 3.22.2 or higher)
  - [Flutter Installation Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extension
- Firebase Project:
  - You need a Firebase project to store your data and handle authentication.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rafay99-epic/MSBridge
   cd MSBridge
   ```

2. **Install Flutter dependencies:**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase:**

   - **Create a Firebase Project:** Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
   - **Add Firebase to Your Flutter App:** Follow the instructions on the Firebase console to add your Flutter app to the project (for both Android and iOS if you intend to support both). This will involve:
     - Registering your app with Firebase.
     - Downloading the `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) configuration files.
     - Placing these files in the appropriate directories within your Flutter project (as specified by Firebase).
   - **Enable Authentication:** In the Firebase console, enable the authentication methods you want to use (e.g., Email/Password, Google Sign-In).
   - **Set up Firestore:** Create a Firestore Database instance and configure the security rules as needed.

4. **API Keys and Firebase Configuration:**

   - **Important:** This project requires Firebase configuration and API keys to function correctly. You need to:
     - Replace the placeholder values in `lib/config.dart` (or similar configuration file) with your actual Firebase API keys and project settings. These values will include (but may not be limited to):
       - `apiKey`
       - `authDomain`
       - `projectId`
       - `storageBucket`
       - `messagingSenderId`
       - `appId`
       - `measurementId`
     - You may also need to configure your API keys and project settings in your AndroidManifest.xml and Info.plist files if prompted by firebase setup.
     - **Security Note:** Never commit your API keys directly to your public repository. Use environment variables or secure configuration management techniques.

5. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Download APK

Now, you can download and experience both versions of the application. Choose the version that suits your needs:

### Latest Version

- **[Download Latest Version](https://rafay99.com/downloads/app/msbridge/release/MSBridge-release.apk)** – The latest version of MS Bridge with the latest features and improvements.

### Previous Versions

- **[Download Version 1](https://rafay99.com/downloads/app/msbridge/v1/MSBridge-V1.apk)** – The initial release with core features and Firebase integration.
- **[Download Version 2](https://rafay99.com/downloads/app/msbridge/v2/MSBridge-V2.apk)** – The latest update with improved performance, new features, and enhanced offline support.

## Branching Versions

This repository utilizes a branching strategy to explore different backend service options. Here's a breakdown of each branch:

- **`main`:** This branch represents the current stable version of MS Bridge and utilizes **Firebase** as its backend service. It offers the core functionality of the application, including offline/online note-taking, authentication, and more.

- **`V1`:** This branch explores **Appwrite** as an alternative backend service. The codebase is largely the same as `main`, but it's configured to interact with Appwrite instead of Firebase.

- **`Firebase-V1`:** This branch contains the old and deprecated Version of the App, the backend is not currently working as intended.

  **Important Note:** The `V1` branch is currently in development. The primary goal is to successfully migrate the application's backend from Firebase to Appwrite.

  **Current Status and Future Plans:** During the initial development of the `V1` branch, challenges were encountered when writing user data to the Appwrite backend. Due to time constraints and the need for a functioning application, the `main` branch was reverted to Firebase. I intend to revisit and resolve these Appwrite-related issues in the future to provide the option of using Appwrite as a backend service.

**Why Multiple Branches?**

The use of separate branches allows for experimentation with different backend solutions without disrupting the stability of the main application. This enables me to:

- Evaluate the performance and scalability of different backend services.
- Explore the features and capabilities offered by each platform.
- Provide users with a choice of backend service in the future (if the Appwrite migration is successful).

## Future Development

The project roadmap includes:

1. **Enhanced Lead Sources**:

   - LinkedIn integration
   - Facebook lead lookup
   - Google search results scraping

2. **Platform Improvements**:

   - Expanded admin dashboard
   - Additional AI models and prompts
   - Comprehensive logging system

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - Codebase optimization
   - Enhanced documentation
   - Monitoring and error handling improvements

## Technical Challenges

One of the main challenges was balancing API costs with functionality:

- Managing Google Maps API usage
- Optimizing AI service calls (OpenAI + Gemini)
- Implementing efficient data caching
- Handling cross-environment data migrations

Despite starting as a simple one-page application, Lead Finder evolved into a full-featured SaaS platform with over 20,000 lines of TypeScript/JavaScript code, demonstrating the power of iterative development and careful architectural decisions.

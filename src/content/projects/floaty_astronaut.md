## 🛠 Development Journey

The idea for Floaty Astronaut came from a love for classic arcade games that prioritize simplicity and skill. I wanted to create something that combined the aesthetics of retro pixel art with a technically engaging experience. Here’s an overview of the development process:

1. **Designing the Concept**: Floaty Astronaut was conceptualized as a simple, skill-based game. I started by sketching out the mechanics and visuals that would convey a sense of space and adventure.
2. **Crafting Pixel Art**: All assets, including the character, spikes, planets, and backgrounds, were designed using pixel art. This approach not only added charm but also kept the assets lightweight and fast to load.
3. **Coding the Mechanics**: Using Unity and C#, I implemented gameplay mechanics that involved smooth movement controls, collision detection, and score tracking.
4. **Adding Sound and Effects**: Sounds were added to enhance immersion, with different tracks for the intro and gameplay, as well as crash effects to make collisions impactful.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

Floaty Astronaut was built with a combination of popular tools and technologies:

- **Unity 2D**: For the game engine, Unity was chosen for its flexibility in 2D game development and its vast asset library.
- **C#**: All game logic was implemented in C#, making it performant and easy to maintain.
- **Pixel Art Software**: Character and environment designs were created in pixel art style, providing a retro feel and lightweight performance.

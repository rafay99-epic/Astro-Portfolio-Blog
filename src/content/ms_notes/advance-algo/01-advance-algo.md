## Questions

*   What are algorithum?
    
*   Why we studies these thing?
    
*   what is the role of algorithum in a tech stack and in the role of hardware.
    

## Algorithm

*   An algorithum is a well defined and effective sequence of computations steps that takes some values, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output.
    
*   It's the process how things are running and how the sequence is performed and the result need to be effect but sequence need to clean and compute these things to the point but un necessay calls and make sure things are in smooth.
    
*   A procedure does not requires an input but an algo needs an input, can be direct or passive input.
    

## Correctness of anlgorithm

*   An Algo is said to be correct for all input is taking and correct with in the limits
    
*   but when the limits are set to be in correct becase might not halt at all some input instances or it might halt with an answer other than desired one.
    

## Core

*   When designing an algo we need to keep these things in mind
    
    *   Need to be revelent
        
    *   it's sign

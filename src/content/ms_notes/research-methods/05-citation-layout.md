In the previous lecture, we covered a lot — how to search for a research paper, how to read it effectively, and how to write a solid abstract. We even discussed how to identify the difference between a good abstract and a weak one, which helps in deciding whether a paper is worth your time or not.

But let’s take things a step further.

Suppose you’ve selected a paper based on the abstract, and the topic seems relevant to your interest or research goals. Now what? What do you actually do once the paper is in your hands?

This is where the **second and third phases of reading a paper** come in — going deep into the content, understanding the methodology, the logic behind the research, the results, and how everything connects. And more importantly, how you can **critically evaluate** the paper, which brings us to today’s focus: the **Review Process**.

* * *

### What is a Review Article?

A **review article** is a type of **secondary literature**. Unlike research articles that present new experiments or data, review articles summarize, compare, and evaluate findings from multiple previously published research papers.

In simpler terms:

> “A review article gives a bird’s eye view of existing research in a particular area. It highlights what’s already known, what problems or gaps still exist, and offers a critical analysis of the progress made so far.”

These articles are **super useful** because they save you time — instead of reading 20 different research papers, you can read one well-written review and understand the bigger picture. They’re especially helpful when you're starting a new research topic and need a **strong foundational understanding**.

## Why Is Reviewing Important?

Whether you're reading a review article or reviewing a research paper yourself, the skill of **critical analysis** is key. Here’s why:

*   It helps you identify flaws, limitations, or biases in research.
    
*   You get better at spotting what makes a study trustworthy and impactful.
    
*   It sharpens your own research thinking — which helps when you’re planning your own study or writing your paper.
    

## What’s Next?

In this lecture, we’ll walk through how to **review a research paper properly** — not just skim it, but actually break it down piece by piece. You’ll learn how to:

*   Understand the structure and intent of each section.
    
*   Evaluate the quality of the research.
    
*   Question the methods, logic, and conclusions.
    
*   Write a proper **review summary or critique**.
    

By the end, you'll not only be better at reading research — you'll be able to **judge** it, challenge it, and maybe even build on it in your own work.

Let’s dive in.

## Literature Review

**Literature Review**, also known as **LR**, is a critical summary of the published works on a particular topic. In this process, you analyze specific issues, identify strengths, trends, and weaknesses of a research paper.

This is how things will flow: when you are reading through the paper — the **introduction**, **related work**, **citations**, **methodology**, and more — you will start to understand how things are laid out by the author and what the author is trying to explain.

With all that, you’ll begin to notice some things the author may have missed or not explored in detail. These observations will come as you read through the paper two or three times.

This is natural — as human beings, we begin to identify patterns and gaps the more we engage with the content. And this entire process is what we call **Literature Review**

## Two Main Methods of Writing a Literature Review

When writing a Literature Review, you can organize your content in different ways depending on what makes the most sense for your topic. Two of the most commonly used structures are:

## 1\. Chronological Approach

### What is it?

The **chronological approach** organizes the literature **by time** — in the order things happened or were published. This helps show how **research has developed over time**, how ideas evolved, and what trends or shifts occurred in the field.

### When to Use:

*   When your topic has **clear historical development**.
    
*   When you want to **highlight progression**, changes in theories, or improvements in methods over time.
    
*   When showing the **timeline** of how a problem emerged or was studied.
    

### How to Write Using Chronological Approach:

*   **Start from the earliest works** related to your topic.
    
*   Show how each study **built upon** the previous one.
    
*   Mention **key breakthroughs** or turning points.
    
*   End with the **most recent** work and current state of the field.
    

> 📝 Example:  
> "In the early 2000s, Smith (2001) introduced X. A few years later, Lee (2007) improved upon this method by introducing Y. Recently, Kumar (2022) has developed a new model that integrates both approaches."

* * *

## 2\. Thematic Approach

### What is it?

The **thematic approach** organizes the literature **by themes, topics, or concepts**, rather than by time. This helps you **group studies** that focus on similar issues, even if they were published years apart.

* * *

### When to Use:

*   When your topic has **multiple angles**, theories, or perspectives.
    
*   When different authors **talk about the same issue** but in **different ways**.
    
*   When you want to show how **different themes** connect, overlap, or conflict.
    

### How to Write Using Thematic Approach:

*   Identify the **key themes** in the literature (e.g., theory A, method B, challenge C).
    
*   Group studies that deal with each theme **together**.
    
*   Compare and contrast what different researchers say **within each theme**.
    
*   Conclude each theme with your own insight or transition to the next theme.
    

> 📝 Example:  
> "Several studies focus on the psychological impact of social media (e.g., Smith, 2019; Zhao, 2021), while others highlight the role of algorithms in shaping content (e.g., Chen, 2020; Nguyen, 2022). Still, a third group explores user behavior and engagement patterns (e.g., Ali, 2018; Raj, 2023)."

* * *

### Key Differences Between the Two:

| Feature | Chronological Approach | Thematic Approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Organized by** | Time / Publication Year | Theme / Concept |
| **Focus** | How the research evolved over time | How different themes relate to the topic |
| **Useful for** | Showing progress or development | Comparing viewpoints, grouping ideas |
| **Example structure** | 2000 → 2005 → 2010 → Present | Theme A → Theme B → Theme C |

* * *

### Which One Should You Use?

*   **Use Chronological** if your topic has **clear historical development** or if you want to show **evolution over time**.
    
*   **Use Thematic** if your topic is **broad, multi-dimensional**, or if you want to **compare different ideas** across time.
    

## Citation Styles

In academic writing, especially in a rigorous field like computer science, proper citation is _essential_. It serves several crucial purposes:

*   **Giving Credit:** Acknowledges the intellectual property of others. You're building on previous work, and it's vital to recognize that foundation.
    
*   **Avoiding Plagiarism:** Using someone else's ideas or words without attribution is a serious academic offense.
    
*   **Enhancing Credibility:** Demonstrates that your work is well-researched and based on reliable sources.
    
*   **Enabling Readers to Verify Information:** Provides a clear path for readers to find the original sources you used, allowing them to evaluate the evidence and delve deeper into the topic.
    
*   **Showing the Evolution of Ideas:** Citation connects your work to the broader conversation within your field, showing how ideas have developed and evolved over time.
    

Different academic disciplines often prefer specific citation styles, each with its own rules for formatting references, in-text citations, and bibliographies. In computer science, ACM, IEEE, and APA are the most commonly encountered.

**1\. ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Citation Style**

*   **Prevalence:** Considered the _primary_ citation style in many areas of computer science, particularly for publications in ACM journals, conferences, and proceedings.
    
*   **Key Features:**
    
    *   **Numeric Citation:** Sources are cited in the text using sequential numbers within square brackets (e.g., \[1\], \[2\], \[3\]). These numbers correspond to the numbered entries in the reference list at the end of the paper.
        
    *   **Reference List:** The reference list, usually titled "References" or "Bibliography," is arranged numerically according to the order in which the sources are cited in the text.
        
    *   **Author Names:** Full first names _are_ generally used, though variations exist depending on the specific ACM publication. The general is First Name Last Name.
        
    *   **Emphasis on Publication Venue:** ACM style places importance on clearly identifying the publication venue (e.g., conference proceedings, journal name, etc.).
        
*   **Example (In-text):**
    
    "As shown by Knuth \[1\], efficient algorithms are crucial for large datasets."
    
*   **Example (Reference List):**
    
    \[1\] D. E. Knuth. _The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1: Fundamental Algorithms_. Addison-Wesley, 1968.
    

**2\. IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Citation Style**

*   **Prevalence:** Widely used in electrical engineering, electronics, and closely related computer science areas like hardware, networking, and signal processing.
    
*   **Key Features:**
    
    *   **Numeric Citation:** Similar to ACM, IEEE uses numbered citations in square brackets in the text (e.g., \[1\], \[2\], \[3\]).
        
    *   **Reference List:** The reference list is also numerically ordered based on the first appearance of each source in the text. It's typically labeled "References."
        
    *   **Author Names:** Generally, only the _initials_ of the first names are used, followed by the last name (e.g., J. Smith).
        
    *   **Emphasis on Specificity:** IEEE often requires very precise details about the source, including page numbers, DOI (Digital Object Identifier) when available, and specific conference locations.
        
*   **Example (In-text):**
    
    "The algorithm proposed by Smith et al. \[2\] offers a significant improvement."
    
*   **Example (Reference List):**
    
    \[1\] J. Doe, “Title of article,” _Journal Name_, vol. x, no. y, pp. zzz-www, Month, Year.
    

**3\. APA (American Psychological Association) Citation Style**

*   **Prevalence:** While primarily used in psychology, education, and social sciences, APA style is sometimes used in computer science, especially in areas that involve human-computer interaction (HCI), educational technology, or the social impact of technology.
    
*   **Key Features:**
    
    *   **Author-Date Citation:** Citations in the text include the author's last name and the year of publication (e.g., (Smith, 2023)). If there are multiple authors, different rules apply for the number of authors cited in the parenthetical citation.
        
    *   **Reference List:** The reference list, titled "References," is arranged alphabetically by the last name of the first author.
        
    *   **Author Names:** Initials are used for the first and middle names of authors. (e.g., J.S. Smith)
        
    *   **Emphasis on Recency:** APA tends to emphasize the publication date, reflecting the importance of current research in these fields.
        
*   **Example (In-text):**
    
    "Recent studies (Brown & Davis, 2022) have shown..." or "Brown and Davis (2022) have shown..."
    
*   **Example (Reference List):**
    
    Brown, A. B., & Davis, C. D. (2022). _Title of the article_. Journal Name, _volume_(issue), page numbers. [https://doi.org/xxxxxxxxxx](https://doi.org/xxxxxxxxxx)
    

**Key Differences Summarized:**

| Feature | ACM | IEEE | APA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In-text Citation | Number in square brackets (\[1\]) | Number in square brackets (\[1\]) | Author (Year) |
| Reference List | Numerical order of appearance | Numerical order of appearance | Alphabetical by author's last name |
| Author Names | Full first name, Last Name | Initials, Last Name | Initials, Last Name |
| Common CS Areas | General CS, Algorithms, Theory | Hardware, Networking, Signal Processing | HCI, EdTech, Social Impact |
| Emphasis | Publication venue, historical context | Specific details, technical accuracy | Recency, psychological/social aspects |

**Tips for Choosing the Right Style:**

*   **Check the Guidelines:** Always refer to the specific style guide for the journal, conference, or institution you are writing for. They often have their own specific requirements or deviations from the standard styles.
    
*   **Consistency is Key:** Once you choose a citation style, adhere to it consistently throughout your entire document.
    
*   **Use Citation Management Software:** Tools like Zotero, Mendeley, or EndNote can significantly simplify the process of managing your references and generating citations in the correct format.
    

**In summary:** ACM, IEEE, and APA each have their own distinct rules and conventions. Understanding these differences is crucial for producing credible and well-researched work in computer science and related fields. Always prioritize the guidelines of the publication or institution for which you are writing.

## **Question: Why do we need these many citation style ?**

Here are some of the reason that I think why there are so many citation syle.

**1\. Disciplinary Differences and Conventions**

*   **Evolution of Specific Fields:** Different academic disciplines have evolved independently over time, developing their own specific norms, values, and ways of communicating knowledge. Citation styles are an integral part of these disciplinary cultures.
    
*   **Emphasis on Different Aspects of Sources:** Disciplines emphasize different information about sources. For example:
    
    *   **Humanities (MLA, Chicago):** Often prioritize the author's name and the work itself, emphasizing the creator and the historical context.
        
    *   **Sciences (APA, IEEE):** Often prioritize the date of publication, reflecting the importance of the most current research.
        
    *   **Hard Sciences & Engineering (IEEE, ACM):** Prioritize conciseness and technical detail, hence the numbered format and focus on specific journal issues/conference proceedings.
        
*   **Varying Collaboration Patterns:** Some fields (like many sciences) have large collaborative projects, leading to multi-authored papers. Styles like APA have evolved to handle complex authorship situations.
    
*   **Types of Sources:** Different fields rely on different types of sources. Some might emphasize books and monographs, while others focus on journal articles or conference proceedings.
    

**2\. Historical Development**

*   **Organic Growth:** Many citation styles didn't spring into existence fully formed. They developed gradually, often through the practices of specific journals, academic associations, or university presses.
    
*   **Early Manuals and Guides:** As academic writing became more formalized, style manuals emerged (e.g., _The Chicago Manual of Style_) to standardize practices. These manuals became influential within certain fields.
    

**3\. Communication Priorities**

*   **Reader Needs:** Different citation styles serve the needs of different readerships.
    
    *   **Accessibility:** Styles like APA aim for accessibility, even for readers outside a specific discipline.
        
    *   **Verification:** Styles like IEEE prioritize enabling readers to quickly locate the exact source and verify technical details.
        
*   **Reducing Clutter:** Numbered systems (like ACM/IEEE) can reduce visual clutter in the text, making it easier to focus on the technical content.
    

**4\. Professional Organizations and Standards**

*   **Establishing Authority:** Professional organizations (like the APA, MLA, IEEE, ACM) have adopted and promoted specific citation styles to establish authority and maintain consistency within their fields.
    
*   **Journals and Publications:** Academic journals often mandate a particular citation style for submissions to ensure uniformity and readability. This reinforces the dominance of certain styles within specific areas.
    

**5\. Practical Considerations**

*   **Software Support:** Citation management software (Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote) has played a role in solidifying the use of particular styles. These tools make it easier to manage references in specific formats.
    
*   **Habit and Inertia:** Once a particular style becomes established in a field, there's often a degree of inertia. Researchers are accustomed to it, and journals are set up to handle it.
    

**In Summary:**

The existence of multiple citation styles is a result of a complex interplay of historical factors, disciplinary differences, communication priorities, and the influence of professional organizations. While it might seem confusing at first, each style is designed to best serve the needs of its particular community of scholars and readers.

## What "et al." Means

"Et al." is a Latin abbreviation that stands for "et alia," which translates to "and others." It's used in citations (especially in APA and IEEE styles, and sometimes in ACM, though less frequently) to shorten the author list when there are multiple authors of a work.

**When to Use "et al."**

The specific rules for using "et al." vary slightly depending on the citation style you are using (APA, IEEE, Chicago, etc.). However, the general principle is to use it when the source has more than a certain number of authors. This limit varies by style.

*   **APA Style (7th Edition):** This is where "et al." usage has changed recently.
    
    *   **For in-text citations:** If a work has **three or more** authors, use "et al." after the first author's name for _all_ citations (including the first one).
        
    *   Example: (Smith et al., 2023)
        
*   **IEEE Style:**
    
    *   IEEE typically lists all authors in the reference list.
        
    *   In the _text_ of your paper, the usage of "et al." depends on the journal or conference guidelines. Often, if there are _more than two_ authors, you would use "et al." after the first author's name.
        
    *   Example: "... as shown by Smith et al. \[12\]."
        
*   **ACM Style:** ACM often encourages listing all authors, especially in the reference list. "Et al." is used less frequently than in APA or IEEE. You'll generally want to follow the specific guidelines of the ACM publication you are submitting to.
    

**Important Notes:**

*   **In the Reference List/Bibliography:** "Et al." is _never_ used in the reference list itself (except in _very_ rare cases where the citation style _explicitly_ allows it, but this is uncommon). The reference list should include all authors' names, up to the maximum number specified by the style guide. If a style guide has a maximum number of authors to list, and the work has more than that, the last author listed is followed by ", et al.".
    
*   **Clarity:** The use of "et al." should not create ambiguity. If using "et al." leads to multiple citations with the same author and year, you may need to include more authors' names to differentiate them.
    

**Example Scenario (APA):**

Let's say you're citing a paper with the following authors:

*   John Smith
    
*   Alice Brown
    
*   David Lee
    
*   Emily Wilson
    

**In-text citation (APA):**

*   (Smith et al., 2023)

**Reference List entry (APA):**

Smith, J., Brown, A., Lee, D., & Wilson, E. (2023). _Title of the article_. Journal Name, _volume_(issue), page numbers. [https://doi.org/xxxxxxxxxx](https://doi.org/xxxxxxxxxx)

**Key takeaway:** "Et al." is a useful shorthand to avoid long and repetitive author lists in your text, making your writing more concise. Always check the specific rules of your chosen citation style.

**Placement of Citations: Ensuring Clarity and Flow**

The placement of in-text citations is crucial for maintaining the clarity and flow of your writing and avoiding ambiguity about which ideas you are attributing to a source. The principle you highlighted – placing the citation _before_ the full stop at the end of a sentence – is generally correct, but there are nuances to consider.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

**1\. Basic Rule: Citation Before the Period**

*   **Principle:** When you are referencing an idea, concept, or information from a specific source within a sentence, the in-text citation (whether it's a number in brackets \[for ACM/IEEE\] or an author-date format \[for APA\]) should generally appear _before_ the final punctuation mark (usually a period, but could also be a question mark or exclamation point) of the sentence.
    
*   **Why:** This immediately signals to the reader that the information in _that specific sentence_ is drawn from the cited source.
    
*   **Example (ACM/IEEE Style):**
    
    "Efficient algorithms are essential for processing large datasets \[1\]."
    
*   **Example (APA Style):**
    
    "Efficient algorithms are essential for processing large datasets (Smith, 2023)."
    
*   **Correct Sentence Construction:** As you noted, the structure is generally:
    
    *   \[Underlined text = your paragraph\]\_\_\_\_\_ \[citation\].
    
    or
    
    *   \[Underlined text = your paragraph\]\_\_\_\_\_ (citation).
    
    followed by the full stop.
    

**2\. Exception: When the Citation is Part of the Sentence's Grammar**

*   Sometimes, the author's name (or the cited work) is grammatically integrated into the sentence. In this case, the year (in APA) or the reference number (in ACM/IEEE) would come _after_ the author's name, but the citation, as a whole, still falls before the final punctuation.
    
*   **Example (APA Style):**
    
    "Smith (2023) argues that efficient algorithms are essential for processing large datasets."
    
    *   Here, the author's name is part of the sentence's structure, so the date follows immediately.
*   **Example (Potentially in ACM/IEEE, though less common):**
    
    "As shown by Knuth \[1\], efficient algorithms are crucial for large datasets."
    
    *   Again, the author and citation are a natural part of the sentence.

**3\. Multiple Citations**

*   If a sentence draws upon multiple sources, cite all relevant sources before the period. The order of citations may depend on the citation style.
    
    *   **APA:** List in alphabetical order by first author's last name: (Brown, 2022; Smith, 2023).
        
    *   **ACM/IEEE:** List in the order they appear or are most relevant, often separated by commas: \[1, 3, 5\].
        
    
    "Several studies have shown the importance of efficient algorithms \[1, 3, 5\]."
    

**4\. Citing a Specific Part of a Source**

*   If you're citing a specific page number, section, or figure within a source, that information usually follows the year (in APA) or the citation number (in ACM/IEEE) and comes _before_ the period.
    
    *   **Example (APA):** "This approach is described in detail (Smith, 2023, p. 45)."
        
    *   **Example (ACM/IEEE - depends on the style guide):** "See Section 3 for a detailed explanation \[1, Section 3\]."
        

**5\. Subsequent Sentences from the Same Source:**

*   If the following sentence _continues_ to draw directly from the _same_ source, you generally do _not_ need to repeat the citation immediately. However, be careful! If you introduce new information or move on to a different idea, you _must_ provide a new citation, even if it's the same source. If there's any ambiguity, it's always best to err on the side of providing a citation.

**6\. Starting a New Paragraph After the Citation**

*   As you mentioned, after the period, you can confidently begin a new paragraph, drawing on a different source or continuing with your own analysis. The period signifies the end of the ideas/information that are being attributed to the previous citation.

**7\. When to Cite at the Beginning of the Sentence**

While citations are typically placed at the end of a clause or sentence, it's sometimes appropriate to begin a sentence with a citation. This is especially useful for highlighting the author of a particularly influential idea or when comparing perspectives.

*   Example (APA): "According to Smith (2023), the use of reinforcement learning can significantly improve the performance of robotics systems."
    
*   Example (ACM/IEEE - less common, more natural wording): "As demonstrated in \[1\], the use of reinforcement learning..."
    

**In summary:** While the general rule is to place the citation before the full stop, always prioritize clarity and avoid ambiguity. Make sure your citation placement accurately reflects which ideas you are attributing to which sources. Refer to your style guide for the specific rules and examples.

## **Paragraph Structure: Building a Solid Foundation**

A well-structured paragraph is the fundamental building block of clear and persuasive academic writing. Each paragraph should focus on a single, identifiable main idea and present it in a coherent and logical manner.

**General Paragraph Structure**

1.  **Topic Sentence:**
    
    *   The _most crucial_ element. It's the sentence that states the main idea of the paragraph. It acts as a mini-thesis statement for the paragraph.
        
    *   It should be clear, concise, and directly related to the overall argument of your paper.
        
    *   Ideally, it's the first or second sentence of the paragraph.
        
2.  **Supporting Sentences:**
    
    *   These sentences provide evidence, explanation, examples, analysis, and reasoning to support the topic sentence.
        
    *   They should be specific, relevant, and build upon the main idea.
        
    *   Use transitions to connect ideas smoothly and show the relationships between sentences.
        
3.  **Examples (Optional):**
    
    *   Concrete examples can make abstract ideas more understandable and compelling.
        
    *   Choose examples that are relevant and illustrate your point effectively.
        
4.  **Analysis and Explanation:**
    
    *   Don't just present evidence; _explain_ its significance. Tell the reader _why_ the evidence supports your claim.
        
    *   Provide your own insights and interpretations.
        
5.  **Challenges/Limitations (Optional):**
    
    *   Addressing potential counterarguments or challenges can strengthen your credibility.
        
    *   Acknowledge limitations or areas where further research is needed.
        
6.  **Concluding/Transition Sentence (Optional):**
    
    *   Summarize the main point of the paragraph or transition to the next paragraph.
        
    *   It provides a sense of closure and maintains the flow of your argument.
        

**Crafting a Compelling Introduction**

The introduction is _critical_. It's your opportunity to grab the reader's attention, establish the context for your work, and clearly state your purpose. As you said, the first impression is the last impression.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the elements you outlined, focusing on creating a captivating introduction:

1.  **Write the Paper First (Then the Introduction):**
    
    *   This is _excellent_ advice. Writing the introduction last allows you to fully understand the scope of your work, your key findings, and the specific contributions you are making. You'll know exactly what you're introducing.
2.  **Tone and Flow:**
    
    *   **Professional Tone:** Maintain a formal and objective tone. Avoid overly casual language or personal opinions.
        
    *   **Smooth Flow:** The introduction should read like a compelling narrative that gradually leads the reader to your research. Each sentence should logically connect to the next.
        
3.  **The "Storytelling" Approach:**
    
    *   The introduction should tell a story – a narrative that captures the reader's interest and explains the _why_ behind your research.
4.  **Key Elements of a Strong Introduction:**
    
    *   **A. Application, Problem, Importance (Start with the "Why"):**
        
        *   **Application:** Begin by highlighting the real-world applications of your topic. Why is it relevant and important?
            
        *   **Problem:** Clearly articulate the problem that your research addresses. What gap are you filling? What issue are you trying to solve?
            
        *   **Importance:** Emphasize the significance of the problem. Why is it worth solving? What are the potential benefits of finding a solution?
            
    *   **B. Motivating Examples:**
        
        *   Provide concrete examples or scenarios that illustrate the problem and its impact. This helps the reader connect with the issue on a personal level.
    *   **C. Challenges:**
        
        *   Acknowledge the challenges or complexities associated with addressing the problem. This shows that you understand the difficulty of the task.
    *   **D. Limitations of the State of the Art:**
        
        *   Critically evaluate existing approaches. What are their shortcomings? What limitations prevent them from fully solving the problem?
            
        *   This justifies the need for your research.
            
    *   **E. Contributions (The "What"):**
        
        *   **Clearly and concisely** state the _novel_ contributions of your research. What new insights, methods, or results have you achieved?
            
        *   Use strong action verbs (e.g., "We propose," "We develop," "We demonstrate").
            
        *   **Avoid overclaiming**. Be realistic about what your research has accomplished.
            
5.  **Brevity and Focus:**
    
    *   The introduction should be relatively short and focused. Avoid going into excessive detail.
        
    *   Save the detailed explanations for the main body of the paper.
        
    *   Everything in the introduction should be designed to set the stage for the rest of the paper.

    *   "In today's data-driven world..." "The increasing demand for..."
        
2.  **Problem Statement:** (1-3 sentences)
    
    *   Clearly articulate the problem or gap that your research addresses.
        
    *   "However, existing methods suffer from..." "This approach is limited by..."
        
3.  **Motivating Examples:** (1-2 sentences)
    
    *   Provide examples or scenarios to illustrate the problem and its impact.
        
    *   "For example, in the context of..." "Consider the case of..."
        
4.  **Challenges:** (1-2 sentences)
    
    *   Acknowledge the challenges associated with solving the problem.
        
    *   "Addressing this problem is challenging due to..." "These limitations stem from..."
        
5.  **Limitations of Existing Approaches:** (2-3 sentences)
    
    *   Critically evaluate the limitations of current methods.
        
    *   "While previous approaches have attempted to address this issue, they often fail to..."
        
6.  **Contributions:** (2-4 sentences)
    
    *   Clearly state the novel contributions of your research. Use strong verbs.
        
    *   "In this paper, we present a novel approach that..." "Our main contributions are as follows:"
        
        *   _Contribution 1_
            
        *   _Contribution 2_
            
        *   _Contribution 3_
            
7.  **Roadmap (Optional):** (1 sentence)
    
    *   Briefly outline the structure of the paper.
        
    *   "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows..."
        
    *   This is recommended in the class, but it depends on the professor you are working with.

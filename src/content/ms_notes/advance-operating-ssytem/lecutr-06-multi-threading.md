# üîπ Process vs Thread

### **Process**

* A **process** is an independent program in execution.
* Each process has its own **memory space** (heap, stack, data, code segments).
* Processes **do not share global variables** by default (unless you use shared memory, pipes, sockets, etc.).
* Context switching between processes is **heavy**, because the OS must save/restore memory maps.

### **Thread**

* A **thread** is a lightweight unit of execution **inside a process**.
* All threads in a process share the **same memory space** (code, heap, global variables).
* But each thread has its own **stack** (local variables and function calls).
* Context switching between threads is **lighter**, since memory is shared.

# üîπ Global Variables in Threads vs Processes

### **In Processes**

* If you define a global variable in one process, **other processes cannot access it directly**.
* Example:

```c
  int counter = 0; // global

  int main() {
      if (fork() == 0) {
          // Child process
          counter++;
          printf("Child: %d\n", counter);
      } else {
          // Parent process
          counter++;
          printf("Parent: %d\n", counter);
      }
  }
```

Output: Both child and parent have **separate copies** of `counter`.

### **In Threads**

* All threads in the same process **share global variables**.
* Example:

```c
  int counter = 0; // global

  void* thread_func(void* arg) {
      counter++;
      printf("Thread: %d\n", counter);
      return NULL;
  }

  int main() {
      pthread_t t1, t2;
      pthread_create(&t1, NULL, thread_func, NULL);
      pthread_create(&t2, NULL, thread_func, NULL);
      pthread_join(t1, NULL);
      pthread_join(t2, NULL);
  }
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Here both threads share `counter`, so:

* Without synchronization ‚Üí **race conditions** may occur.
* With locks (mutex/semaphore) ‚Üí safe increments.

# üîπ Diagram

### **1. Processes (Separate Memory)**

```
+------------------+      +------------------+
| Process A        |      | Process B        |
|                  |      |                  |
| Global Var = 5   |      | Global Var = 5   |   <-- Separate copies
| Heap             |      | Heap             |
| Stack            |      | Stack            |
| Code             |      | Code             |
+------------------+      +------------------+
```

* Even if both declare the same global variable, they are **not shared**.

### **2. Threads (Shared Memory)**

```
+--------------------------------------------+
| Process                                    |
|                                            |
| Global Var = 5   <-----------------------+ |
| Heap             (Shared across threads) | |
| Code                                      | |
|                                            |
|  +------------+   +------------+           |
|  | Thread 1   |   | Thread 2   |           |
|  | Stack      |   | Stack      |           |
|  +------------+   +------------+           |
+--------------------------------------------+
```

* Global variables are **shared**, but each thread has its **own stack**.

# üîπ Key Differences

| Feature          | Processes                             | Threads                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Memory space     | Independent                           | Shared                               |
| Global variables | Separate                              | Shared                               |
| Overhead         | High (context switch)                 | Low                                  |
| Communication    | IPC needed (pipes, sockets, etc.)     | Direct via shared memory             |
| Fault tolerance  | Safer (one crash doesn‚Äôt kill others) | Riskier (one crash can kill process) |

# üîπ Issues with Global Variables in Threads

1. **Race Conditions** ‚Äì two threads updating at the same time ‚Üí inconsistent data.
   * Example: `counter++` is **not atomic**.
2. **Synchronization Needed** ‚Äì use mutexes, semaphores, or atomic operations.
3. **Deadlocks** ‚Äì improper locking order can freeze threads.
4. **Scalability Problems** ‚Äì too many threads sharing global state ‚Üí contention.

## üîπ Benefits of Threads

1. **Resource Sharing**
   * All threads of a process share code, data, and files.
   * Easier communication compared to inter-process communication (IPC).
2. **Responsiveness**
   * If one thread is blocked (e.g., waiting for I/O), others can continue execution.
   * Example: In a web browser, one thread renders the page while another downloads images.
3. **Faster Context Switching**
   * Switching between threads is lighter than switching between processes since memory and resources are shared.
4. **Economical**
   * Creating and managing threads requires fewer system resources than processes.
5. **Better Utilization of Multiprocessor Architectures**
   * Threads can run in parallel on multiple CPU cores ‚Üí higher throughput.
6. **Scalability**
   * Threads allow applications (like servers, databases, simulations) to handle many tasks at once efficiently.

***

## üîπ Types of Threads

### 1. **User-Level Threads (ULTs)**

* Managed by **user-level libraries**, not the OS kernel.
* OS sees only the main process, not individual threads.
* **Advantages:**
  * Fast to create, switch, and schedule (no kernel involvement).
  * Can be implemented on any OS (even if the OS doesn‚Äôt support threads).
* **Disadvantages:**
  * If one thread makes a blocking system call ‚Üí entire process is blocked.
  * Cannot take advantage of multiprocessor systems (kernel only schedules the process as one unit).

### 2. **Kernel-Level Threads (KLTs)**

* Managed directly by the **operating system kernel**.
* OS schedules and manages threads individually.
* **Advantages:**
  * True parallelism on multiprocessor systems.
  * If one thread blocks, others in the same process can continue.
* **Disadvantages:**
  * Slower to create and manage (kernel overhead).
  * More memory and resources required.

### 3. **Hybrid Threads**

* Combine **user-level** and **kernel-level** threads.
* User-level library creates and manages threads, but they are mapped onto kernel threads.
* Example models:
  * **Many-to-One:** Many user threads mapped to one kernel thread.
  * **One-to-One:** Each user thread maps to a kernel thread (used in modern OS like Windows, Linux).
  * **Many-to-Many:** Many user threads mapped to many kernel threads (flexible, but complex).
* **Advantages:**
  * Balances efficiency and parallelism.
  * Better performance for large-scale applications.

***

## üîπ How Threads Work in the OS

1. **Thread Creation**
   * The OS (or a user-level library) allocates a stack and control block for each thread.
2. **Scheduling**
   * **User-level threads:** Scheduler is part of the thread library.
   * **Kernel-level threads:** Scheduler is part of the OS kernel.
   * **Hybrid:** Both user library and kernel cooperate.
3. **Context Switching**
   * Saves and restores the thread‚Äôs registers, stack pointer, and program counter.
   * Faster than process context switch since memory is shared.
4. **Synchronization**
   * Since threads share global variables and memory, OS provides synchronization primitives:
     * **Mutexes**
     * **Semaphores**
     * **Monitors**
     * **Spinlocks**
   * Prevents race conditions and ensures consistency.
5. **Communication**
   * Easier compared to processes (no need for IPC).
   * Threads communicate through shared memory (global variables, heap).
6. **Execution on Multiprocessors**
   * Kernel-level and hybrid threads can be scheduled on different CPUs ‚Üí true parallelism.
   * OS thread scheduler balances load across cores.

    end

```

## üîπ Process Suspension

* **Suspension** = process is put into a **waiting state** (paused), but not destroyed.
* Reasons:
  1. **I/O wait** (waiting for disk, network, etc.)
  2. **Resource request** (waiting for memory, lock, semaphore)
  3. **User/system request** (admin pauses a process)
  4. **Parent process suspension** (child often suspended with it)
* Suspended process stays in **main memory** or can be swapped to disk.

## üîπ Thread Suspension

* A **thread** inside a process can also be suspended:
  * E.g., waiting for I/O or waiting for a lock (mutex).
* Since **threads share memory**, suspension of one thread does **not** suspend the whole process (other threads keep running).
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Exception: If the **main thread** (the one that created others) suspends itself, the OS may block the entire process.

## üîπ Process Termination

* When a process terminates:
  * All **threads** inside it are also terminated automatically.
  * OS reclaims resources: memory, files, I/O, descriptors.
* Types:
  1. **Normal termination** ‚Äì process finishes execution.
  2. **Error termination** ‚Äì program crashes, illegal instruction, divide by zero, etc.
  3. **Killed by another process** ‚Äì e.g., `kill -9` in Linux.
  4. **Parent termination** ‚Äì may cause child termination (depends on OS).

## üîπ Thread Termination

* A **thread** terminates when:
  1. It finishes its task (normal exit).
  2. It is explicitly killed (e.g., `pthread_cancel` in POSIX).
  3. The process itself terminates ‚Üí all threads inside die.
* Thread termination may cause:
  * **Resource cleanup** (stack freed, registers released).
  * **Impact on process**: if it‚Äôs the main thread, the **entire process ends** unless other threads are detached.

## üîπ Linking Between Suspension & Termination

1. **Process ‚Üî Threads**
   * Suspending a process = all threads inside are suspended.
   * Terminating a process = all threads inside are terminated.
2. **Thread ‚Üî Process**
   * Suspending a thread = only that thread is paused (others may still run).
   * Terminating the main thread can end the whole process.

## üîπ Tree Structure (Multi-Threaded Process)

Think of a **process tree** like a family:

```
Process (Parent)
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Thread 1 (Main thread)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Thread 2 (Worker)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Thread 3 (Worker)
```

* If **Process dies** ‚Üí all threads are killed.
* If **Thread 1 dies** (and it‚Äôs the main thread) ‚Üí process usually dies ‚Üí all other threads die too.
* If **Thread 2 or 3 dies** ‚Üí only that branch ends, process continues.

## üîπ Diagram (Mermaid)

Here‚Äôs a diagram for clarity:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph P [Process]
        T1[Thread 1 - Main]
        T2[Thread 2]
        T3[Thread 3]
    end

    P -->|Termination| X[All threads die]
    T1 -->|If main thread ends| X
    T2 -->|Worker thread ends| P
    T3 -->|Worker thread ends| P

```

## üîπ Example Scenarios

### Example 1: Web Browser

* **Process**: Browser main process.
* **Threads**:
  * UI thread ‚Üí renders interface.
  * Network thread ‚Üí downloads files.
  * Tab threads ‚Üí run web pages.
* If the **browser process** crashes ‚Üí all tabs & downloads stop.
* If one **tab thread** crashes ‚Üí only that tab stops, browser continues.

### Example 2: Word Processor

* **Process**: MS Word.
* **Threads**:
  * Main thread ‚Üí handles user input.
  * Auto-save thread ‚Üí saves file every 5 min.
  * Spell-check thread ‚Üí checks text in background.
* If process is **suspended** (e.g., OS swaps it out) ‚Üí all threads paused.
* If the **auto-save thread** dies ‚Üí program still works, but no backup saves.

## üßµ User-Level Threads (ULTs)

### üîπ What They Are

* **Managed in user space** (library level), not by the OS kernel.
* The **OS sees only the process** ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt know threads exist inside it.
* Threading library (like **pthreads**, **green threads**, or Java threads) does scheduling & switching.

## üîπ How They Work

1. **OS ‚Üí Process**
   * The OS scheduler gives **CPU time** to the whole process.
   * It does **not** know about internal threads.
2. **Process ‚Üí Threads**
   * Inside the process, a **thread library** (user-level) decides which thread runs.
   * Context switching between threads is done by the **library**, not the OS.
3. **Execution Flow**

```
   Hardware (CPU) ‚Üí OS Kernel ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Thread Library ‚Üí Thread Execution
```

## üîπ Advantages of ULTs

* **Fast switching**: No kernel involvement ‚Üí just library calls.
* **Portable**: Same library works across OSes.
* **Custom scheduling**: Process can implement its own policies (priority, round robin, etc.).

## üîπ Issues / Limitations

1. **Blocking Problem** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   * If one ULT makes a **blocking system call** (e.g., `read()` on disk), the **entire process blocks**.
   * Why? Because the OS only sees **one process**, not multiple threads.
   * ‚Üí All threads inside are paused.
2. **No true parallelism** üö´
   * On a multicore CPU, the OS schedules the **whole process** onto one core at a time.
   * So threads cannot run on multiple cores simultaneously.
3. **Resource allocation blind spot**
   * The OS allocates resources (CPU time, memory) **per process**, not per thread.
   * Threads have to **share** what the process gets.

## üîπ Resource Allocation to ULTs

* **Memory**: All ULTs share code, data, heap. Each has its **own stack**.
* **CPU time**: The OS gives a time slice to the **process**. The thread library divides it among threads.
* **I/O**: OS handles I/O at process level, so one blocking call can freeze everything.

## üîπ Flow Diagram (ULT Execution)

    OS --> P["Process Control Block"]
    P --> TL["User Thread Library"]
    TL --> T1["Thread 1"]
    TL --> T2["Thread 2"]
    TL --> T3["Thread 3"]
    
    T1 -.->|Blocking I/O| P
    T2 -.->|Shares Process resources| P
    T3 -.->|Shares Process resources| P

```

## üîπ Example: Web Server with ULTs

* Suppose a web server process runs **100 user-level threads** for client connections.
* OS only sees **1 process**.
* If one thread does a blocking `read()` ‚Üí OS pauses the whole process ‚Üí all 100 clients freeze.

Perfect, this is the natural next step after **User-Level Threads**. Let‚Äôs dive into **Kernel-Level Threads (KLTs)** and contrast them with ULTs so the picture is complete.

## üßµ Kernel-Level Threads (KLTs)

### üîπ What They Are

* **Managed directly by the OS kernel**.
* OS scheduler sees **each thread** as an independent schedulable entity.
* Examples: Windows threads, Linux `pthread` (when mapped to kernel), Solaris threads.

### üîπ How They Work (Flow)

1. **Hardware ‚Üí OS Kernel**
   * CPU runs an instruction, traps to kernel for scheduling.
2. **OS Kernel ‚Üí Threads**
   * Kernel thread table stores **registers, state, stack pointer** for each thread.
   * OS scheduler picks **which thread** (not just which process) runs next.
3. **Threads ‚Üí Process**
   * Threads still belong to a process (share its address space, code, heap).
   * But they can be scheduled independently across CPUs.

üìå Execution Path:

```
Hardware (CPU) ‚Üí OS Kernel Scheduler ‚Üí Thread (inside Process)
```

### üîπ Advantages of KLTs

1. **True Parallelism** üñ•Ô∏è
   * Multiple threads of the same process can run **simultaneously on multiple cores**.
   * Example: Browser rendering one tab while downloading in another.
2. **Non-blocking behavior** üö¶
   * If one thread makes a **blocking system call**, the OS can still schedule another thread from the same process.
3. **Fine-grained scheduling**
   * OS decides priority, time-slicing, and load balancing across CPUs.

### üîπ Disadvantages of KLTs

1. **Higher overhead** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   * Switching between kernel threads requires **mode switch (user ‚Üî kernel)**.
   * More expensive than ULT context switching (which happens in user space).
2. **OS dependency**
   * Implementation depends on OS support ‚Üí less portable than ULTs.
3. **Complex management**
   * Requires kernel data structures, synchronization, and more bookkeeping.

### üîπ Resource Allocation

* **Memory**: Shared among threads, but each thread has its **own stack & registers** stored in the kernel.
* **CPU time**: Kernel scheduler assigns time to **individual threads**.
* **I/O**: One thread can block on I/O while others in the same process continue running.

```

### üîπ Example: Database Server

* **Process**: MySQL server.
* **Threads**:
  * Query thread (handling SQL request).
  * I/O thread (reading from disk).
  * Background cleanup thread.
* If query thread blocks ‚Üí OS can still run I/O thread.
* On a multicore machine, queries can run **truly in parallel**.

### üîπ ULT vs KLT Quick Table

| Feature           | User-Level Threads (ULT)             | Kernel-Level Threads (KLT)             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Managed by        | User-level library                   | OS kernel                              |
| Visibility to OS  | OS sees only process                 | OS sees each thread                    |
| Context switch    | Very fast (no kernel call)           | Slower (requires kernel involvement)   |
| Blocking syscalls | Blocks whole process                 | Only blocks the calling thread         |
| Parallelism       | Not true parallelism (one core only) | True parallelism across multiple cores |
| Portability       | High (library only)                  | Low (OS-specific support needed)       |

## üåê Multithreading Models

Since we can have threads managed by the **user space library** (user-level threads, ULTs) and also by the **kernel** (kernel-level threads, KLTs), the OS needs a way to map one to the other. This mapping is what we call **multithreading models**.

There are **three classic models**:

### 1. **Many-to-One Model**

* **How it works:**
  * Multiple user threads (ULTs) are mapped to a **single kernel thread**.
  * The OS only sees *one thread per process*.
  * The user-level thread library handles scheduling among user threads.
* **Pros:**
  * Simple and efficient for context switching (only in user space).
  * No need for kernel support for threading.
* **Cons:**
  * **Blocking problem**: If one ULT makes a blocking system call, the whole process (all threads) is blocked.
  * Cannot take advantage of multiprocessor systems since only one kernel thread runs.
* **Diagram:**

```
  [ULT1] \
  [ULT2]  > ----> [Single KLT] ----> [CPU]
  [ULT3] /
```

### 2. **One-to-One Model**

* **How it works:**
  * Each user thread is mapped to **its own kernel thread**.
  * The OS manages scheduling and execution directly.
* **Pros:**
  * True parallelism on multiprocessors.
  * If one thread blocks, others can still run.
* **Cons:**
  * **Overhead**: Creating a user thread requires creating a kernel thread (more expensive).
  * Some OSes limit the number of threads that can be created due to kernel resource usage.
* **Diagram:**

```
  [ULT1] ---> [KLT1] ---> CPU
  [ULT2] ---> [KLT2] ---> CPU
  [ULT3] ---> [KLT3] ---> CPU
```

### 3. **Many-to-Many Model**

* **How it works:**
  * Multiple user threads are mapped to multiple kernel threads.
  * The thread library schedules user threads onto a smaller or equal pool of kernel threads.
  * The OS and user library **share responsibility** for scheduling.
* **Pros:**
  * Flexible: Can exploit parallelism but also avoid excessive kernel thread creation.
  * Solves the blocking problem: if one ULT blocks, another can still be scheduled on a different KLT.
* **Cons:**
  * More complex to implement (requires cooperation between user and kernel).
  * Higher coordination overhead.
* **Diagram:**

```
  [ULT1] \
  [ULT2]  > ---> [KLT1] ---> CPU
  [ULT3] / \
           \---> [KLT2] ---> CPU
```

### 4. **Two-Level Model (Variation of Many-to-Many)**

* **How it works:**
  * Similar to Many-to-Many but allows some ULTs to be **bound** to specific KLTs.
  * Gives flexibility and also efficiency for certain "critical" threads.
* **Example:**
  * A thread that performs real-time I/O may be bound to a kernel thread for direct execution, while other threads are multiplexed.

## üîÑ Workflow (Flow of Execution)

1. **User creates a thread** ‚Üí User-level library handles the creation.
2. **Depending on model**:
   * In *Many-to-One*: Only one kernel thread represents all threads.
   * In *One-to-One*: Each ULT ‚Üí new KLT in the kernel.
   * In *Many-to-Many*: ULT scheduler assigns ULT ‚Üí available KLT.
3. **Kernel schedules KLTs** ‚Üí Maps them to CPUs.
4. **Execution happens** ‚Üí ULT runs on top of the assigned KLT.

üí° Quick comparison table:

| Model        | Parallelism? | Blocking Issue? | Efficiency | Complexity |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Many-to-One  | ‚ùå No         | ‚úÖ Yes           | ‚úÖ High     | ‚ùå Low      |
| One-to-One   | ‚úÖ Yes        | ‚ùå No            | ‚ùå Low      | ‚úÖ Medium   |
| Many-to-Many | ‚úÖ Yes        | ‚ùå No            | ‚úÖ Medium   | ‚ùå High     |
| Two-Level    | ‚úÖ Yes        | ‚ùå No            | ‚úÖ Medium   | ‚úÖ Higher   |

    "whoAmI": "I am a Full Stack Software Engineer and Team Lead who builds production-ready web and mobile applications used by real users. My work sits at the intersection of clean architecture, performance, and delivery. I have led engineering teams, owned critical systems, and shipped applications across Android, iOS, and the web using modern stacks like React, Next.js, Flutter, and Node.js. I don’t just build features—I think through system design, edge cases, scalability, and long-term maintainability to create software teams can confidently build on.",

Competitive gaming plays a big role in how I recharge, sharpening decision-making, teamwork, and adaptability under pressure. Exploring new experiences helps me reset and maintain balance, which directly influences how I approach problem-solving and collaboration in my professional life.",
    "continuousLearning": "I treat learning as a core part of my work. I continuously refine my skills by adopting new tools, revisiting architectural decisions, and improving how systems are built and maintained. My learning is driven by real problems such as scaling applications, improving performance, reducing complexity, and helping teams work more effectively together. Through mentorship, collaboration, and technical leadership, I focus on building software that lasts."
